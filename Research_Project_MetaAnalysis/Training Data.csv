 QTc interval predicts outcome of catheter ablation in paroxysmal atrialfibrillation patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ," Catheter ablation has been recommended as a treatment option for paroxysmalatrial fibrillation (PAF) patients complicated with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM). PAF patients with T2DM have a higher recurrence rate after catheterablation. Prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interval has been linked to pooroutcomes in T2DM patients. Whether the abnormal QTc interval is associated withthe ablation outcome in the PAF patients with T2DM remains unknown. In thisstudy, 134 PAF patients with T2DM undergoing primary catheter ablation wereretrospectively enrolled. Pre-procedural QTc interval was corrected by using theBazett's formula. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to assess therelationship between QTc interval and the recurrence of AF. After a 29.1-monthfollow-up period, 61 patients experienced atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence.Recurrent patients had a longer QTc interval than non-recurrent patients(425.2+/-21.5 ms vs. 414.1+/-13.4 ms, P=0.002). Multivariate Cox regressionanalysis revealed that QTc interval [hazard ratio (HR)=1.026, 95% confidenceinterval (CI) 1.012-1.040, P=0.005] and left atrial diameter (LAD) (HR=1.125, 95%CI 1.062-1.192, P=0.003) were independent predictors of recurrent atrialtachyarrhythmia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that thecut-off value of QTc (418 ms) predicted arrhythmia recurrence with a sensitivityof 55.7% and a specificity of 69.9%. A combination of LAD and QTc was moreeffective than LAD alone (P<0.001) in predicting arrhythmia recurrence after theprocedure. QTc interval could be used as an independent predictor of arrhythmiarecurrence in T2DM patients undergoing AF ablation, thus providing a simplemethod to identify those patients who likely have a better outcome following theprocedure.

 Reply: Recent Diabetes and Atrial Fibrillation Report Diverges From Pre-ExistingEvidence. ,"Diabetes is a consistently identified but moderately weak risk factor for ischemic stroke in patients with AF. The aforementioned studies sought aspects of diabetes more proximal to the cause of stroke to better inform the use of OAC for AF. For now, patients with longer-duration diabetes should be viewed as being at higher risk than those with a relatively recent onset.",no,old
 Recent Diabetes and Atrial Fibrillation Report Diverges From Pre-ExistingEvidence. ,"We read with interest the study by Ashburner et al. (1), investigating associations between duration of diabetes, glycemic control, and risk of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) cohort.

They found that duration of diabetes is an important predictor of ischemic stroke in patients with AF, suggesting that an arbitrary duration threshold of ?3 years may be a useful cut-off. These findings serve partly as valuable confirmation of observations from another recent analysis including >17,000 patients with AF and concomitant diabetes that investigated a similar issue (2). Here, the risk of a composite outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism according to diabetes duration exhibited a linear dose-response relationship, with the highest risk observed among patients with diabetes duration ?15 years. These previous data do not support a risk threshold at 3 years of duration as observed in the ATRIA study.",no,old
 Calpain-Calcineurin-Nuclear Factor Signaling and the Development of AtrialFibrillation in Patients with Valvular Heart Disease and Diabetes. ," Calpain, calcineurin (CaN), and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) play akey role in the development of atrial fibrillation. Patients with valvular heartdisease (VHD) are prone to develop atrial fibrillation (AF). Thus, our currentstudy was aimed at investigating whether activation of calpain-CaN-NFAT pathwayis associated with the incidence of AF in the patients with VHD and diabetes. Theexpressions of calpain 2 and alpha- and beta-isoforms of CaN catalytic subunit(CnA) as well as NFAT-c3 and NFAT-c4 were quantified by quantitative reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction in atrial tissues from 77 hospitalizedpatients with VHD and diabetes. The relevant protein content was measured byWestern blot and calpain 2 in human atrium was localized by immunohistochemistry.We found that the expressions of calpain 2, CnA alpha and CnA beta, and NFAT-c3but not NFAT-c4 were significantly elevated in the samples from patients with AFcompared to those with sinus rhythm (SR). Elevated protein levels of calpain 2and CnA were observed in patients with AF, and so was the enhanced localizationof calpain 2. We thereby concluded that CaN together with its upstream molecule,calpain 2, and its downstream effector, NFAT-c3, might contribute to thedevelopment of AF in patients with VHD and diabetes. ",no,old
 Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in patients withdiabetes mellitus: Who benefits and who does not? Data from the German ablationregistry. ," BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor forcardiovascular disease and arrhythmias. Procedural data and complication rates inpatients with DM undergoing catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmias are unknown.METHODS: The German Ablation Registry has been designed as a multi-centerprospective registry. Between January 2007 and January 2010 data from ablation ofright atrial flutter (AFlut) and atrial fibrillation (AF) were collected from 51German centres. Patients with DM and without DM were compared. RESULTS: Weincluded 8175 patients who underwent catheter ablation of AFlut or AF. Patientswith DM (n=944) were older and presented significantly more severe comorbidities.Major periprocedural complications did not significantly differ between patientswith and without DM for both ablation of AFlut and AF. Kaplan-Meier survivalanalysis for 366days of follow-up, showed a significant increase of MACCE for DMpatients as compared to controls after AFlut [6.1% vs. 3.4%(p=0.002)], but notafter AF ablation [1.2% vs. 0.9%(p=0.59)]. Ablation of AFlut led to a comparablereduction of palpitations and NYHA class in both patient groups. AF ablationreduced palpitations and NYHA class in patients without DM, while patients withDM reported no improvement of NYHA class despite a reduction of palpitations.CONCLUSION: As compared to non-DM, patients with DM show no increasedperiprocedural risk and no increased arrhythmia recurrence after ablation ofAFlut or AF. As expected patients with DM exhibit more comorbidities and anincreased ongoing mortality after atrial flutter ablation presumably caused bythe higher age of this group as compared to controls.

 Diabetes mellitus and risk of ischemic stroke in patients with heart failure andno atrial fibrillation. ," OBJECTIVE: The risk of ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, and all-causedeath among heart failure patients previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus ispoorly described. We evaluated the risk of these endpoints among heart failurepatients without diagnosed atrial fibrillation according to the presence ofdiabetes mellitus. METHODS: Population-based nationwide cohort study ofnon-anticoagulated patients diagnosed with incident heart failure during2000-2012, identified by record linkage between nationwide registries in Denmark.We calculated relative risks after 1year to evaluate the association betweendiabetes and risk of events in 39,357 heart failure patients, among whom 18.1%had diabetes. Analysis took into account competing risks of death. RESULTS:Absolute risks of all endpoints were higher in patients with diabetes compared topatients without diabetes after 1-year follow-up (ischemic stroke: 4.1% vs. 2.8%;systemic thromboembolism: 11.9% vs. 8.6%; all-cause death: 22.1% vs. 21.4%).Diabetes was significantly associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke(adjusted relative risk [RR]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.51);systemic thromboembolism (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.11-1.30); and all-cause death (RR:1.17, 95% CI: 1.11-1.23). Additionally, time since diabetes diagnosis wasassociated with higher adjusted cumulative incidences of ischemic stroke,systemic thromboembolism, and all-cause death (p for trend, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Among heart failure patients without atrial fibrillation, diabeteswas associated with a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke, systemicthromboembolism, and all-cause death compared to those without diabetes, evenafter adjustment for concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. Increased focus onsecondary prevention in heart failure patients with diabetes may be warranted. ",no,old
 A Diabetes-Atrial Fibrillation Conundrum: Does Duration Trump Glycemia? ,"The disease and cost burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) is expected to double over the next 25 years (1).

 Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with diabetes mellitus: asystematic review and meta-analysis. ," AIMS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and atrial fibrillation (AF) sharepathophysiological links, as supported by the high prevalence of AF within DMpatients. Catheter ablation of AF (AFCA) is an established therapeutic option forrhythm control in drug resistant symptomatic patients. Its efficacy and safetyamong patients with DM is based on small populations, and long-term outcome isunknown. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess safetyand long-term outcome of AFCA in DM patients, focusing on predictors ofrecurrence. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic review was conducted inMEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials, clinicaltrials, and observational studies including patients with DM undergoing AFCA werescreened and included if matching inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fifteenstudies were included, adding up to 1464 patients. Mean follow-up was 27 (20-33)months. Overall complication rate was 3.5 (1.5-5.0)%. Efficacy in maintainingsinus rhythm at follow-up end was 66 (58-73)%. Meta-regression analysis revealedthat advanced age (P < 0.001), higher body mass index (P < 0.001), and higherbasal glycated haemoglobin level (P < 0.001) related to higher incidence ofarrhythmic recurrences. Performing AFCA lead to a reduction of patients requiringtreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) from 55 (46-74)% at baseline to 29(17-41)% (P < 0.001) at follow-up end. CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation of AFsafety and efficacy in DM patients is similar to general population, especiallywhen performed in younger patients with satisfactory glycemic control. Catheterablation of AF reduces the amount of patients requiring AADs, an additionalbenefit in this population commonly exposed to adverse effects of AFpharmacological treatments. ",no,old
 NT-proBNP values in elderly heart failure patients with atrial fibrillation anddiabetes. ," AIM: To evaluate N-terminal pro-BNP-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)plasmatic levels in heart failure patients with/without atrial fibrillation(AFib) and with/without diabetes (DM). METHODS: The study enrolled 120 patientswith heart failure, age 71.26+/-9.14, 48.3% AFib and 30.8% with DM. The patientswere divided into 4 groups according to the presence or absence of AFib and DM:group 1, 46 patients in sinus rhythm (SR) without DM; group 2, 16 patients in SRwith DM; group 3, 37 patients with AFib and without DM; group 4, 21 patients withboth AFib and DM. RESULTS: The patients in SR with DM displayed lower NT-proBNPlevels than those with AFib without DM (1196.75+/-1183.11 vs 1940.59+/-963.665,p=0.02). We recorded no significant difference in comparison with the patientswho had both AFib and DM (1196.75+/-1183.11 vs 1452.67+/-1257.94, p=NS). Therewas no significant difference between groups 3 and 4. Statistically significantcorrelations between ejection fraction, namely NYHA class and NT-proBNP levelswere recorded only in the patients in SR-group 1 (r=-0.42, p<0.01) and group 2(r=-0.66, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between plasma NT-proBNP levels andejection fraction, namely NYHA class, were evinced only in patients in SR. ",no,old
 Effect of an intensive lifestyle intervention on atrial fibrillation risk inindividuals with type 2 diabetes: the Look AHEAD randomized trial. ," BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with higher risk of atrial fibrillation (AF),but the impact of behavioral weight loss interventions on atrial fibrillation(AF) risk in persons with diabetes is unknown. We addressed this question in theLook AHEAD randomized trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 5,067 overweight orobese individuals 45 to 76 years old with type 2 diabetes without prevalent AFwere randomized to either an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) designed toachieve and maintain weight loss through caloric reduction and increased physicalactivity or a diabetes support and education usual care group. Atrialfibrillation was ascertained from electrocardiograms at study examinations andhospitalization discharge summaries. Multivariable Cox models were used toestimate the intention-to-treat effect of the intervention adjusting for baselinecovariates. During a mean follow-up of 9.0 years, 294 incident AF cases wereidentified. Rates of AF were comparable in the ILI and diabetes support andeducation groups (6.1 and 6.7 cases per 1,000 person-years, respectively, P =.42). The intervention did not affect AF incidence (multivariable hazard ratio[HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.77-1.28). Similarly, neither weight loss nor improvement inphysical fitness during the first year of the intervention was significantlyassociated with AF incidence: multivariable hazard ratio (95% CI) comparing topversus bottom quartile was 0.70 (0.41-1.18) for weight loss and 0.88 (0.55-1.43)for physical fitness improvement. CONCLUSION: In a large randomized trial ofoverweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, an ILI that induced modestweight loss did not reduce the risk of developing AF. ",no,old
" Efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with diabetes and nonvalvularatrial fibrillation: the Rivaroxaban Once-daily, Oral, Direct Factor XaInhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke andEmbolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF Trial). "," BACKGROUND: The prevalence of both atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus(DM) are rising, and these conditions often occur together. Also, DM is anindependent risk factor for stroke in patients with AF. We aimed to examine thesafety and efficacy of rivaroxaban vs warfarin in patients with nonvalvular AFand DM in a prespecified secondary analysis of the ROCKET AF trial. METHODS: Westratified the ROCKET AF population by DM status, assessed associations with riskof outcomes by DM status and randomized treatment using Cox proportional hazardsmodels, and tested for interactions between randomized treatments. For efficacy,primary outcomes were stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or non-central nervoussystem embolism. For safety, the primary outcome was major or nonmajor clinicallyrelevant bleeding. RESULTS: The 5,695 patients with DM (40%) in ROCKET AF wereyounger, were more obese, and had more persistent AF, but fewer had previousstroke (the CHADS2 score includes DM and stroke). The relative efficacy ofrivaroxaban and warfarin for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism wassimilar in patients with (1.74 vs 2.14/100 patient-years, hazard ratio [HR] 0.82)and without (2.12 vs 2.32/100 patient-years, HR 0.92) DM (interaction P = .53).The safety of rivaroxaban vs warfarin regarding major bleeding (HRs 1.00 and 1.12for patients with and without DM, respectively; interaction P = .43), major ornonmajor clinically relevant bleeding (HRs 0.98 and 1.09; interaction P = .17),and intracerebral hemorrhage (HRs 0.62 and 0.72; interaction P = .67) wasindependent of DM status. Adjusted exploratory analyses suggested 1.3-, 1.5-, and1.9-fold higher 2-year rates of stroke, vascular mortality, and myocardialinfarction in DM patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The relative efficacy andsafety of rivaroxaban vs warfarin was similar in patients with and without DM,supporting use of rivaroxaban as an alternative to warfarin in diabetic patientswith AF.

 Duration of Diabetes Mellitus and Risk of Thromboembolism and Bleeding in AtrialFibrillation: Nationwide Cohort Study. ," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Guidelines advocate anticoagulant treatment to allpatients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant diabetes mellitus. Thepotential refinement to thromboembolic risk stratification that may spring fromsubdividing diabetes mellitus is unexplored. The purpose was to investigateduration of diabetes mellitus as a predictor of thromboembolism andanticoagulant-related bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS:Using nationwide Danish registries, we identified all patients discharged fromhospital with an incident diagnosis of atrial fibrillation from 2000 to 2011.Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for thromboembolism and bleedingaccording to years of diabetes mellitus duration in categories (0-4, 5-9, 10-14,and >/=15) and as a continuous variable using cubic splines were calculated byCox regression. RESULTS: The study population comprised 137 222 patients withatrial fibrillation, of which 12.4% had diabetes mellitus. Compared with patientswithout diabetes mellitus and after adjustment for anticoagulant treatment andCHA2DS2-VASc components (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, previousstroke, vascular disease, and sex), the risk of thromboembolism was lowest in the0 to 4 years duration category (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval,1.03-1.20), and highest in the longest duration category of >/=15 years (hazardratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.70). When analyzed as a continuousvariable, duration of diabetes mellitus was associated with risk ofthromboembolism in a dose-response-dependent manner, but not with a higher riskof bleeding during anticoagulant treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrialfibrillation, longer duration of diabetes mellitus was associated with a higherrisk of thromboembolism, but not with a higher risk of anticoagulant-relatedbleeding. Considering the critical balance between preventing thromboembolism andavoiding bleeding, longer duration of diabetes mellitus may favor initiation ofanticoagulant therapy. ",no,old
" Heart failure and comorbidities: renal failure, diabetes, atrial fibrillation,and inflammation. ","eart failure is a clinical syndrome that involves many organs outside the heart, most importantly the kidney.1,2 In a timely Clinical Review article entitled ‘The kidney in heart failure: an update’, Kevin Damman from the University Medical Center Groningen in The Netherlands3 reminds us of this fact. Renal dysfunction occurs frequently in all types of heart failure and, when present, is associated with higher mortality and morbidity.4While the pathophysiology is multifactorial, the most important factors are a reduced renal perfusion and venous congestion. Recent interest has focused on worsening renal function,5 a condition strongly related to mortality. Unfortunately, to date, clinicians have been unable to identify specifically those patients with a grim prognosis following worsening renal function. Although much has been learned regarding cardiorenal interaction in heart failure, many questions remain unanswered. Further research is needed for an updated classification of the cardiorenal syndrome, and to improve preventive and treatment strategies preserving renal function and improving outcome in heart failure patients.",no,old
 Elevated glycated hemoglobin levels may increase the risk of atrial fibrillationin patients with diabetes mellitus. ," BACKGROUND: As the most common cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (AF) isalways accompanied with various complications if without detection and treatmenttimely. Blood-based pleiotropic molecule biomarkers have now been popularlyapplied in clinical detection. We hence performed this meta-analysis to evaluatethe correlation of serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels with the risk of AFin patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: Covering myriads ofcomputerized databases, we identified potential relevant studies for statisticalanalysis. We used a standard reporting form to extract data from each includedstudy. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) criteria was used for methodological qualityassessment. Statistical analyses were conducted with the STATA statisticalsoftware. RESULTS: Six cohort studies in full text fulfilled our inclusioncriteria, and following overestimation indicated that serum levels of HbA1c in DMpatients with AF was higher than that in DM patients without AF (SMD = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.39-0.94, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses by sample size and detection methodimplicated that elevated serum HbA1c levels exhibited significant correlationswith an increased risk of AF in DM patients in the large-size subgroup (n >/=200), the small-size subgroup (n < 200), the high performance liquidchromatography (HPLC) subgroup and the non-HPLC subgroup (Large-size: SMD = 0.70,95% CI: 0.38-1.03, P < 0.001; Small-size: SMD = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.09-1.19, P =0.023; HPLC: SMD = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.49-1.12, P < 0.001; Non-HPLC: SMD = 0.36, 95%CI: 0.04-0.68, P = 0.029; respectively). CONCLUSION: Elevated serum HbA1c levelsmay be associated with an increased risk of AF in DM patients, possiblyreflecting that serum HbA1c level might be a potential biomarker in theprediction of AF in DM patients.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The main efficacy endpoints were SSE andmortality; safety endpoints were major and major/clinically relevant non-majorbleeding. A total of 4547/18 201 (24.9%) patients had diabetes who were younger(69 vs. 70 years), more had coronary artery disease (39 vs. 31%), and higher meanCHADS2 (2.9 vs. 1.9) and HAS-BLED scores (1.9 vs. 1.7) (all P < 0.0001) thanpatients without diabetes. Patients with diabetes receiving apixaban had lowerrates of SSE [hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.05),all-cause mortality (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67-1.02), cardiovascular mortality (HR0.89, 95% CI 0.66-1.20), intra-cranial haemorrhage (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.95),and a similar rate of myocardial infarction (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.62-1.67) comparedwith warfarin. For major bleeding, a quantitative interaction was seen(P-interaction = 0.003) with a greater reduction in major bleeding in patientswithout diabetes even after multivariable adjustment. Other measures of bleedingshowed a consistent reduction with apixaban compared with warfarin without asignificant interaction based on diabetes status. CONCLUSION: Apixaban hassimilar benefits on reducing stroke, decreasing mortality, and causing lessintra-cranial bleeding than warfarin in patients with and without diabetes. ",no,old
 High risk factors of atrial fibrillation in type 2 diabetes: results from theChinese Kailuan study. ," BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological mechanisms for atrial fibrillation (AF)vulnerability in diabetic patients are largely unclear. AIM: To investigate thehigh risk factors of AF in Chinese Kailuan diabetes. DESIGN: A retrospectivereview of AF in Chinese Kailuan diabetes. METHODS: Research and statisticanalysis on the clinical data of 9050 diabetic patients from Kailuan Coal MineGroup Corporation who participated in a health survey from July 2006 to October2007. RESULTS: Sixty diabetic patients (50 males and 10 females) were diagnosedwith AF during the health checkup, with a prevalence of 0.66% (0.67% in males and0.62% in females). Univariate analysis showed that patients with AF were olderand had higher levels of serum uric acid (UA), pulse pressure, serum c-reactiveprotein and anti-hypertensive medication usage, but lower levels of fasting bloodglucose and triglycerides (TG). Multivariate analysis indicated that older age(OR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.06-1.12), increased UA (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.01) anddecreased TG (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.55-0.92) were independent predictive factorsof AF after adjusting for other variables. After gender stratification, age andUA remained as independent predictive factors of AF in both male and femalepatients. However, TG had an independent inverse association with AF in malepatients only. CONCLUSIONS: Age and UA are independent predictive factors of AFin both male and female diabetic patients. TG is inversely correlated with AF inmale diabetic patients only. ",no,old

 HbA1c levels as predictors of ablation outcome in type 2 diabetes mellitus andparoxysmal atrial fibrillation. ," AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the levels of HbA1c couldpredict the outcome of ablation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The studycomprised 149 consecutive patients with T2DM and PAF who underwent their firstcircumferential pulmonary vein isolation. HbA1c levels were measured beforeablation. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to assess therelationship between HbA1c levels and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF).RESULTS: Of the 149 patients, 60 (40.3 %) developed AF recurrence after a median12-month follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that leftatrium size and HbA1c were independent predictors of recurrent atrialtachyarrhythmia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that anHbA1c cut-off value of >/= 6.9 % predicted recurrence with 55.0 % sensitivity and67.4 % specificity (AUC = 0.634). The success rate of ablation was 69.0 % inpatients with an HbA1c value of < 6.9 % compared with 46.8 % in those with anHbA1c value of >/= 6.9 % (log-rank test, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: High levels ofHbA1c were associated with an increased risk of recurrence of atrialtachyarrhythmia in patients with T2DM and PAF undergoing catheter ablation. ",no,old
 Beneficial effects of pioglitazone on retardation of persistent atrialfibrillation progression in diabetes mellitus patients. ," This study aimed to explore the effects of pioglitazone treatment on progressionfrom persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) to permanent atrial fibrillation indiabetes mellitus (DM) patients and to investigate the possible mechanismsinvolved in those effects.A total of 146 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients withfirstly identified persistent AF were selected. Seventy patients were randomizedinto the pioglitazone (30 mg/day) group and 76 into the placebo group.Pro-collagen type I carboxyterminal peptide (PICP), advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), and angiotensin II were assayed and left atrial diameter (LAdiameter) was measured at the first presence of persistent AF, and at 6 and 14months of follow-up. The time point of identification of permanent AF and theincidence of permanent AF in the patients were all recorded.Thirty-seven (49%) ofthe 76 patients in the placebo group and 21 (30%) of the 70 patients in thepioglitazone group progressed to permanent AF (P = 0.028). No significantdifferences existed in the follow-up time (20.5 +/- 3.97 months for pioglitazonegroup versus 20.9 +/- 4.14 months for placebo group) between the two groups (P =0.535). In the pioglitazone group, no significant change was found in angiotensinII level. The PICP level did not change significantly at 6-months of follow-up,but decreased significantly at 14-months of follow-up (P = 0.032). The AGE (P =0.037 at 6-month follow-up, P < 0.035 at 14-month follow-up) level wassignificantly lower at both 6 and 14-months of followup.By lowering the PICPlevel, pioglitazone treatment may decrease the incidence of permanent AF in DMpatients with persistent AF, which may be associated with the suppressing effectof pioglitazone on AGEs.

 Defining the role of oxidative stress in atrial fibrillation and diabetes. ,"AF may result from abnormalities in atrial electrical activity generated from improper impulse formation or propagation. This inappropriate activity is primarily associated with electrical and/or structural remodeling (e.g., ectopic activity or altered conduction caused by fibrosis). While the molecular mechanisms of AF are not completely understood, key factors that result in AF have been identified. One such factor is oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation exceeds degradation. Primary sources of ROS within the heart and associated with AF include mitochondria, NADPH oxidase, and xanthine oxidase.2, 3 Furthermore, in AF, there may be additional sources that elevate ROS production (e.g. monoamine oxidase).4 Finally, in AF, down regulation of enzymes that degrade ROS (e.g., superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) exacerbate oxidative stress phenotypes.5 Subsequently, elevated ROS may modify ion channel activity to increase AF susceptibility. For example, elevated ROS results in shortening of the atrial action potential duration (APD) by increasing the transient outward current (Ito)6 and producing delayed after depolarizations (DADs) by increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release via enhanced ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity.7",no,old

HRV analysis evidenced that LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in theSAFE group than in the non-SAFE group (P<0.05) in the whole period of HManalysis. AF absolute burdens were positively correlated with LF/HF ratio(r=0.31, P<0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that LF/HF ratio was anindependent determinant of AF episodes. CONCLUSIONS: This study originally showeda strong relationship between autonomic dysfunction and silent atrialfibrillation in type 2 diabetes. ",no,old
 Impact of intensive glycemic control on the incidence of atrial fibrillation andassociated cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study). ," Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(DM) and is associated with markers of poor glycemic control; however, the impactof glycemic control on incident AF and outcomes is unknown. The aims of thisstudy were to prospectively evaluate if intensive glycemic control in patientswith DM affects incident AF and to evaluate morbidity and mortality in patientswith DM and incident AF. A total of 10,082 patients with DM from the Action toControl Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) cohort were studied in arandomized, double-blind fashion. Participants were randomized to an intensivetherapeutic strategy targeting a glycated hemoglobin level of <6.0% or a standardstrategy targeting a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0% to 7.9%. Incident AFoccurred in 159 patients (1.58%) over the follow-up period, at a rate of 5.9 per1,000 patient-years in the intensive-therapy group and a rate of 6.37 per 1,000patient-years in the standard-therapy group (p = 0.52). In a multivariate model,predictors of incident AF were age, weight, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,and heart failure history. Patients with DM and new-onset AF had a hazard ratioof 2.65 for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 3.86, p <0.0001),a hazard ratio of 2.1 for myocardial infarction (95% confidence interval 1.33 to3.31, p = 0.0015), and a hazard ratio of 3.80 for the development of heartfailure (95% confidence interval 2.48 to 5.84, p <0.0001). In conclusion,intensive glycemic control did not affect the rate of new-onset AF. Patients withDM and incident AF had an increased risk for morbidity and mortality comparedwith those without AF.

 Association of metformin with lower atrial fibrillation risk among patients withtype 2 diabetes mellitus: a population-based dynamic cohort and in vitro studies. ," BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), an inflammatory process involvingarrhythmia, is associated with severe morbidity and mortality and commonly seenin patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). The effect of metformin, the mostcommonly used medication for patients with DM, on AF has not been investigated.The primary aim of this study was to examine whether metformin prevented theoccurrence of AF in type 2 DM patients by analyzing a nationwide,population-based dynamic cohort. Additionally, we investigated the effect ofmetformin on tachycardia-induced myolysis and oxidative stress in atrial cells.METHODS: The study population included 645,710 patients with type 2 diabetes andnot using other anti-diabetic medication from a subset of the Taiwan NationalHealth Insurance Research Database. Of these patients, those who used metforminwere categorized as the user group, and the remaining were classified as thenon-user group. The time-dependent Cox's proportional hazard model was used toexamine the effect of metformin on AF and the status of metformin use was treatedas a time-dependent covariate. HL-1 atrial cells were paced with or withoutmetformin, and then troponin and heavy-chain-myosin were measured as markers ofmyolysis. RESULTS: After 13 years of follow-up, 9,983 patients developed AF withan incidence rate of 1.5% (287 per 100,000 person-years). After adjusting forco-morbidities and medications, metformin independently protected the diabeticpatients from new-onset AF with a hazard ratio of .81 (95% confidence interval0.76-0.86, p < 0.0001). Metformin significantly decreased the extent ofpacing-induced myolysis and the production of reactive oxygen species.CONCLUSION: Metformin use was associated with a decreased risk of AF in patientswith type 2 DM who were not using other anti-diabetic medication, probably viaattenuation of atrial cell tachycardia-induced myolysis and oxidative stress.

 Cryptogenic stroke and diabetes: a probable link between silent atrialfibrillation episodes and cerebrovascular disease. ," Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular eventsindependently of other factors such as age, sex, BMI and blood pressure. Diabetesplays an important role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation because itcauses alterations to the autonomic nervous system. It may also be associatedwith an increased prevalence of asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation,which cause cerebrovascular disease more often than chronic atrial fibrillation.The presence of silent cerebral ischemia doubles the risk of stroke in thegeneral population independently of other cardiovascular risk factors; therefore,early detection of these episodes is important to determine preventive measuresagainst the first cerebrovascular disease.

 Effects of prescribed antithrombotics and other cardiovascular pharmacotherapieson all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes and atrial fibrillation - acohort study from Sweden using propensity score analyses. ," AIMS: To study mortality rates among patients with diabetes and concomitantatrial fibrillation (AF), prescribed different cardiovascular drugs in primaryhealth care. METHODS: Study population consisted of men (n = 1319) and women (n =1094) aged >/=45 years from a database including 75 primary care centres inSweden. Cox regression analysis, with hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidenceinterval (95% CIs) and mortality (years to death) as outcome, and Laplaceregression, with difference in time to first 10% mortality (with 95% CI), wereperformed. Independent variables were prescribed cardiovascular drugs. Regressionmodels were adjusted for a propensity score calculated separately for eachprescribed drug class (comprising age, cardiovascular co-morbidities, education,marital status and pharmacotherapy). RESULTS: Overall mortality was lower in thewhole sample for anticoagulants vs no treatment (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.26-0.77); andamong patients < 80 years for anticoagulants vs. antiplatelets (HR 0.44; 95% CI0.25-0.78); while among individuals aged >/=80 years, antiplatelets (HR 0.47; 95%CI 0.26-0.87) and anticoagulants (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.24-1.00) vs. no treatmentwere equally effective. Statins were associated with lower mortality among those<80 years (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.29-0.71). Laplace regression models in the wholesample, with years to first 10% of total mortality as outcome, were significantfor: among patients < 80 years anticoagulants vs. no treatment 2.70 years (95% CI0.04-5.37), anticoagulants vs. antiplatelets 2.31 years (95% CI 0.84-3.79), andthose >/=80 antiplatelets vs. no treatment 1.78 years (95% CI 1.04-2.52).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that antiplatelets could exert a beneficialeffect among those above 80 years.

 Relation of elevated serum uric acid levels to incidence of atrial fibrillationin patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ," The association between serum uric acid (SUA) levels and atrial fibrillation (AF)is currently poorly known. We examined the association between SUA levels andrisk of incident AF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We followed for 10years a random sample of 400 type 2 diabetic outpatients, who were free from AFat baseline. A standard 12-lead electrocardiography was undertaken annually and adiagnosis of incident AF was confirmed in affected participants by a singlecardiologist. Over 10 years, there were 42 incident AF cases (cumulativeincidence of 10.5%). Elevated SUA level was associated with an increased risk ofincident AF (odds ratio 2.43, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 3.4, p <0.0001 foreach 1-SD increase in SUA level). Adjustments for age, gender, body mass index,hypertension, chronic kidney disease, electrocardiographic features (leftventricular hypertrophy and PR interval), and use of diuretics and allopurinoldid not attenuate the association between SUA and incident AF (adjusted oddsratio 2.44, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 3.9, p <0.0001). Further adjustmentfor variables that were included in the 10-year Framingham Heart Study-derived AFrisk score did not appreciably weaken this association. Results remainedunchanged even when SUA was modeled as a categorical variable (stratifying byeither SUA median or hyperuricemia), and when patients with previous coronaryheart disease or heart failure were excluded from analysis. In conclusion, ourfindings suggest that elevated SUA levels are strongly associated with anincreased incidence of AF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus even afteradjustment for multiple clinical risk factors for AF.

We studied a hospital-based sample of 702 patientswith Type 2 diabetes discharged from our Division of Endocrinology during2007-2011. The diagnosis of AF was confirmed in affected participants on thebasis of ECGs and medical history by experienced cardiologists. NAFLD was definedby ultrasonographic detection of hepatic steatosis in the absence of other liverdiseases. Of the 702 hospitalized patients included in the study, 514 (73.2%) ofthem had NAFLD and 85 (12.1%) had persistent or permanent AF. NAFLD wasassociated with an increased risk of prevalent AF {OR (odds ratio), 3.04 [95% CI(confidence interval), 1.54-6.02]; P<0.001}. Adjustments for age, sex, systolicBP (blood pressure), HbA1c, (glycated haemoglobin), estimated GFR (glomerularfiltration rate), total cholesterol, electrocardiographic LVH (left ventricularhypertrophy), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and prior history ofHF (heart failure), VHD (valvular heart disease) or hyperthyroidism did notattenuate the association between NAFLD and AF [adjusted OR, 5.88 (95% CI,2.72-12.7); P<0.001]. In conclusion, our results show that ultrasound-diagnosedNAFLD is strongly associated with an increased prevalence of persistent orpermanent AF in patients with Type 2 diabetes, independently of several clinicalrisk factors for AF. The potential impact of NAFLD on AF deserves particularattention, especially with respect to the implications for screening andsurveillance strategies in the growing number of patients with NAFLD.

 Pioglitazone may offer therapeutic advantages in diabetes-related atrialfibrillation. ,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common sustained arrhythmias encountered in clinical practice. Atrial remodeling promotes the occurrence or maintenance of AF by acting on the fundamental arrhythmia mechanisms. Inflammation and oxidative stress play a possible role in the pathogenesis of atrial remodeling [1]. The focus is the role of atrial fibrosis in AF. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the strongest independent risk factors for subsequent AF and has pathophysiological links with AF [2–4]. Diabetes-related changes in metabolic functioning, as well as abnormalities in inflammatory and oxidative states, compromise the ability of atrial tissue to remodel after injury and to recover and sustain functionality. Due to anti-inflammatory properties of pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-? activator, it might exert beneficial effects on atrial remodeling and AF promotion",no,old
 Relation of heart-rate recovery to new onset heart failure and atrialfibrillation in patients with diabetes mellitus and preserved ejection fraction. ," Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is a possible link between abnormal metabolism intype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) and heartfailure (HF). The aim of this study was to elucidate the association betweenattenuated heart rate recovery (HRR) and these manifestations of myocardialdysfunction in T2DM. Nine hundred fourteen consecutive patients with T2DM (meanage 56 +/- 11 years, 508 men) without diabetes mellitus complications, withnegative results on stress echocardiography, were enrolled. Patients with knowncardiac disease were excluded. Demographics, clinical assessment, co-morbidities,and insulin use were collected prospectively. The association of HRR withnew-onset HF and AF was sought using a Cox proportional-hazards model. There were47 events (22 HF and 25 AF) during a median follow-up period of 7.8 years. Eventswere associated with age, exercise capacity, HRR, and left atrial volume indexbut not with baseline glycosylated hemoglobin, left ventricular mass index, orstandard markers of diastolic function. In sequential Cox models for the combinedoutcomes, the model based on clinical data (age and gender; overall chi-square =5.5) was not significantly improved by left atrial volume index (chi-square =8.6, p = 0.10) or maximum METs (chi-square = 8.7, p = 0.07) but was significantlyimproved by adding HRR (chi-square = 19.7, p = 0.004). In addition, HRR providedsignificant incremental prognostic value regarding the composite end point (netreclassification improvement 19.2%, p = 0.04; integrated discriminationimprovement 1.58%, p = 0.004). In conclusion, the association of HRR withsubsequent HF and AF, independent of and incremental to left atrial volume indexand other markers of abnormal cardiac structure and function, indicates a rolefor autonomic neuropathy as the link between metabolic and cardiac risk inpatients with T2DM.

The new oral anticoagulants were superior to warfarin irrespective ofgender or the presence of diabetes. For nonparoxysmal AF, event rates are similarwith warfarin and new anticoagulants. There is some suggestion of the benefit ofnew oral anticoagulants in patients with paroxysmal AF. For patients withoutheart failure, the new drugs are superior, whereas in patients with evidence ofheart failure the new drugs were similar to warfarin. In conclusion, new oralanticoagulants are better than warfarin irrespective of gender or the presence ofdiabetes mellitus.

 Contrasting effects of diabetes and metabolic syndrome on post-operative atrialfibrillation and in-hospital outcome after cardiac surgery. ,"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of metabolic perturbations reflecting insulin resistance, i.e. central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, reduced HDL cholesterol, hypertension, and glucose intolerance [1]. MS is associated with a heightened risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease. Several studies reported that MS significantly impacts clinical outcomes after cardiac surgery, and is an independent predictor of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF), the most common post-operative complication [2], [3], [4] and [5]. The specific link between MS, DM and POAF may have been blurred by the inclusion in the aforementioned studies of a large number of patent diabetic patients in MS groups since half of them had already transitioned from beginning insulin resistance to DM. Indeed, patients with type 2 DM are not excluded from the definition of metabolic syndrome in either ATPIII or IDF criteria [1], and consequently, most patients with type 2 DM can in fact be identified with the various criteria for the diagnosis MS.",no,old
 Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased mean platelet volume in patientswith type 2 diabetes mellitus. ," Platelet abnormalities in diabetes mellitus (DM) and atrial fibrillation (AF) mayunderline the etiology of a prothrombotic state in these conditions.

Patients who had type 2 DM with eitherchronic (>/=6 months) AF or normal sinus rhythm (NSR) were included in the study.A total of 162 patients (aged 38-89 years) were divided into 2 groups accordingto the presence of either AF or NSR. Group 1 consisted of 81 diabetic patientswith AF, and group 2 consisted of 81 diabetic patients with NSR. The two groupswere not significantly different in terms of age, and gender, as well as inhypertension, smoking, history of coronary artery disease, previouscerebrovascular accidents, microalbuminuria, retinopathy, duration of DM, bodymass index, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteincholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride (p > 0.05 forall variables). Although no significant difference was present between groupsconcerning platelet count; for patients with AF, MPV was higher compared withpatients with NSR (9.0 +/- 0.2 fl vs. 8.4 +/- 0.2 fl; p = 0.001). Furthermore, nosignificant difference was noted between groups regarding routine medicationsreceived by patients. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, MPV was theonly variable independently related to AF (OR = 2.659; 95% CI, 1.286-5.498; p =0.008). Consequently, it is concluded that AF is associated with increased MPV inpatients with type 2 DM, suggesting the presence of tentatively related processesleading to reciprocal interaction. ",no,old

Similarly we havewitnessed a parallel rise in the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), thecommonest sustained cardiac arrhythmia, which is also a significant cause ofcardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Part of this increase is attributable toadvances in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF)improving life expectancy and consequently the prevalence of AF. However,epidemiological studies have demonstrated an independent association betweenobesity and AF, possibly reflecting common pathophysiology and risk factors forboth conditions. Indeed, weight gain and obesity are associated with structuraland functional changes of the cardiovascular system including left atrial andventricular remodeling, haemodynamic alterations, autonomic dysfunction, anddiastolic dysfunction. Moreover, diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by anadverse structural and functional cardiac phenotype which may predispose to thedevelopment of AF [3]. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological andmechanistic relationships between obesity, diabetes and AF, and the challengesposed in the management of this high-risk group of individuals.

We provide the page reference of the original description of every species and genus listed and of many synonyms. We note the existence of recent reviews, phylogenies and keys of each of the tribes and genera included. Coastal Staphylinidae contain eight subfamilies: Microsilphinae, Omaliinae, Pselaphinae, Aleocharinae, Oxytelinae, Scydmaeninae, Paederinae, and Staphylininae.By 'coastal habitats' we mean habitats existing on the sea coast and subject to inundation or at least splashing by the very highest tides. This includes rocky, boulder, coral, sandy, and muddy seashores, and at least portions of salt-marshes, estuaries, and mangrove swamps. We exclude the sand dune habitat and higher parts of sea-cliffs.The list notes distribution of all the species, first according to the ocean or sea on whose shores it has been recorded, and second by country (and for the larger countries by province or state). Although this distribution is undoubtedly incomplete, it provides a basis for future development of a dedicated database.The 'Habitats, Habits, and Classificatory Notes' section is designed to provide ecologists with further taxonomic and ecological information. It includes references to descriptions of the immature stages, behavior of adults and immatures, their food, natural enemies, and habitat. We would have preferred to separate these entities, but current knowledge of ecology is developed in few instances beyond natural history.The Pacific Ocean basin was the origin and contributed to the dispersal of the majority of specialist coastal Staphylinidae at the level of genus. However, at the level of species, species belonging to non-coastal-specialist genera are about as likely to occur on the shores of other oceans as on the shores of the Pacific. This difference is a reflection of the antiquity of coastal genera and species.A complete bibliography, and habitat and habitus photographs of some representative coastal Staphylinidae species are provided.",no,old

 Risks of cardiovascular events and effects of routine blood pressure loweringamong patients with type 2 diabetes and atrial fibrillation: results of theADVANCE study. ," AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate serious clinical outcomesassociated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the effects of routine bloodpressure lowering on such outcomes in the presence or absence of AF, amongindividuals with type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: About 11 140 patients withtype 2 diabetes (7.6% of whom had AF at baseline) were randomized to a fixedcombination of perindopril and indapamide or placebo in the Action in Diabetesand Vascular Disease: preterAx and diamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE)study. We compared total mortality and cardiovascular disease outcomes andeffects of randomized treatment for 4.3 years on such outcomes between patientswith and without AF at baseline. After multiple adjustments, AF was associatedwith a 61% (95% confidence interval 31-96, P < 0.0001) greater risk of all-causemortality and comparable higher risks of cardiovascular death, stroke, and heartfailure (all P < 0.001). Routine treatment with a fixed combination ofperindopril and indapamide produced similar relative, but greater absolute, riskreductions for all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities in patients with AF,compared with those without AF. The number of patients needed to be treated withperindopril-indapamide for 5 years to prevent one cardiovascular death was 42 forpatients with AF and 120 for patients without AF at baseline. CONCLUSION: Atrialfibrillation is relatively common in type 2 diabetes and is associated withsubstantially increased risks of death and cardiovascular events in patients withtype 2 diabetes. This arrhythmia identifies individuals who are likely to obtaingreater absolute benefits from blood pressure-lowering treatment. Atrialfibrillation in diabetic patients should be regarded as a marker of particularlyadverse outcome and prompt aggressive management of all risk factors. ",no,old
 Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with diabetes mellitus type2: results from a randomized study comparing pulmonary vein isolation versusantiarrhythmic drug therapy. ," INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) oftencoexist; however, a small number of patients with DM2 undergoing catheterablation (CA) of AF have been included in previous studies. The aim of this studywas to evaluate safety and efficacy of ablation therapy in DM2 patients with drugrefractory AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2005 to September 2006, 70patients with a diagnosis of DM2 and paroxysmal (n = 29) or persistent (n = 41)AF were randomized to receive either pulmonary vein isolation or a newantiarrhythmic drug treatment (ADT) with a 1-year follow-up. The primary endpointwas the time to first AF recurrence. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, at the end offollow-up, 42.9% of patients in the ADT group and 80% of patients who received asingle ablation procedure and were without medications were free of AF (P =0.001). In the ablation group, a significant improvement in quality-of-life (QoL)scores as compared with ADT group was observed. Six patients in the ADT group(17.1%) developed significant adverse drug effects. Hospitalization rate duringfollow-up was higher in the ADT group (P = 0.01). The only complicationattributable to ablation was one significant access-site hematoma. CONCLUSION: Inpatients with DM2, CA of AF provides significant clinical benefits over the ADTand appears to be a reasonable approach regarding feasibility, effectiveness, andlow procedural risk.

" Chronic atrial fibrillation: Incidence, prevalence, and prediction of strokeusing the Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age >75, Diabetes mellitus, andprior Stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS2) risk stratification scheme. "," BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is to estimate the incidence and prevalence ofchronic AF (cAF) in the United Kingdom and test the accuracy of the CHADS2 scorefor stroke prediction. METHODS: The General Practice Research Database was usedto identify patients aged 40+ years diagnosed with cAF and control patients.Harrell's C-statistic was used to test possible improvements in CHADS2. RESULTS:The study population included 51,807 cAF patients. The incidence of cAF increasedby age and was higher in men than women. The prevalence of cAF has increased overtime. The excess 5-year risk for stroke in cAF patients correlated well withCHADS2 as follows: score 0, 1.9% (95% CI 1.6-2.1); 1, 3.0% (95% CI 2.7-3.3); 2,4.7% (95% CI 4.3-5.1); 3, 7.2% (95% CI 6.6-7.9); 4, 10.5% (95% CI 9.4-11.5); 5,13.9% (95% CI 12.2-15.5); and 6, 15.8% (95% CI 13.5-18.1). Adding sex, theextension of age categories and reweighing of established risk factors improvedCHADS2 accuracy (C-statistic 0.68-0.72). Applying the reclassification resultedin a substantial number of patients changing stroke risk category. CONCLUSION:Atrial fibrillation is a prevalent and growing problem, which significantlyincreases the risk of ischemic stroke. The CHADS2 score is a good predictor ofthe stroke risk but could be improved. ",no,old
 Inflammation: another potential mechanism between diabetes mellitus and atrialfibrillation. ,"We would like to provide another potential mechanism in this setting. It has been demonstrated recently that inflammatory response may underlie pathologic processes of DM.2 Inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor–?, and interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 are elevated in patients with DM.2 These proinflammatory cytokines may also act on the pancreatic islets and induce progressive ?-cell failure, which is the most important mechanism for the development of DM.3 Recent studies have also suggested that exercise and lifestyle changes could reduce the incidence of DM and inflammation.2 However, recent studies have demonstrated the possible implication of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AF.4, 5 and 6 Our previous studies have also shown that increased baseline C-reactive protein levels are associated with greater risk for immediate failure of electrical cardioversion4 and AF recurrence after successful electrical cardioversion.6 Also, several non-channel-blocking drugs with anti-inflammatory properties have shown beneficial effects in AF. These include inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, statins, corticosteroids, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin C, thiazolidinediones, and others.7, 8, 9 and 10 Therefore, we presume that DM-related inflammation might contribute to the development of AF.",no,old
 Comparative evaluation of effect of valsartan/amlodipine and atenolol/amlodipinecombinations on atrial fibrillation recurrence in hypertensive patients with type2 diabetes mellitus. ," The aim of this study was to compare the effect of valsartan/amlodipine andatenolol/amlodipine combination in preventing the recurrence of atrialfibrillation (AF) in hypertensive diabetic patients with a history of recentparoxysmal atrial fibrillation. Two hundred ninety-six hypertensive patients withwell-controlled type 2 diabetes in sinus rhythm but with at least 2ECG-documented episodes of AF in the previous 6 months were randomized to 160 mgof valsartan plus amlodipine (titrated from 2.5 to 10 mg) or to 100 mg ofatenolol plus amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg) in addition to their previousantiarrhythmic treatment (if any) and were followed up for 1 year. Blood pressure(BP) and a 24-hour ECG were evaluated monthly. The patients were asked to reportany episode of symptomatic AF and to perform an ECG as early as possible. SBP/DBPvalues were significantly reduced after 12 months with valsartan/amlodipine (from150.4/93.5 to 126.37/7.4 mm Hg, P < 0.001) and atenolol/amlodipine (from151.1/94.2 to 127.1/77.9 mm Hg, P < 0.001), with no difference between the 2regimens. At least 1 ECG-documented episode of AF was reported in 20.3% of thepatients treated with valsartan/amlodipine and in 34.1% of those treated withatenolol/amlodipine, with a significant difference between treatments (P < 0.01).The positive effect of valsartan/amlodipine combination on AF recurrence was moreevident in patients treated with amiodarone or propafenone than in patientstreated with other antiarrhythmic drugs or without antiarrhythmic treatment.Despite similar BP reduction, valsartan/amlodipine combination was more effectivein patients treated with amiodarone or propafenone than atenolol/amlodipine inpreventing new episodes of AF in hypertensive diabetic patients.

 Influence of diabetes on the maintenance of sinus rhythm after a successfuldirect current cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation. ," AIM: To determine independent risk factors for recurrence of atrial fibrillation(AF) after a successful direct current (DC) cardioversion in patients with andwithout diabetes. DESIGN: We retrospectively analysed the outcome in patientsrecently diagnosed with persistent AF. METHODS: Of 364 patients included, 289 hada successful direct current (DC) cardioversion. We compared 42 (14.5%) patientsknown to have diabetes to 247 (85.5%) without. Patients were reviewed inoutpatient clinic with assessment of heart rhythm clinically and byelectrocardiogram. Median follow-up after DC cardioversion was 74 days[interquartile range (IQR) 69-78 days]. RESULTS: When reviewed in outpatientclinic, only 63.7% (185 of 289) were still in sinus rhythm (SR). Of the groupwithout diabetes, 66.8% (165 of 247) remained in SR vs. 45.2% (19 of 42) of thegroup with diabetes (P = 0.005). Binary logistic regression analysis showedduration of AF (P < 0.0001) and the presence of diabetes (P = 0.019) have beenindependent risk factors for recurrence of AF.

 Safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients withdiabetes mellitus--single center experience. ," BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the outcome of catheter ablationof atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Weinvestigated the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of AF in patients withDM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty one patients with DM from a group of 263consecutive patients undergoing a first-time catheter ablation of AF procedurewere enrolled in a prospective study. The ablation protocol (guided by CARTOsystem) consisted in two continuous circular lesions around ipsilateral pulmonaryveins. RESULTS: The following clinical characteristics differed between DM andno-DM patients: age (62.0 +/- 10.8 vs. 56.1 +/- 10.6 years, P = 0.004), longer AFhistory (9.6 +/- 9.3 vs. 6.7 +/- 6.3 years, P = 0.024), significantly larger leftatrium size (41.1 +/- 7.8 vs. 38.3 +/- 5.8 mm, P = 0.021), hypertension (58.1 vs.35.8%, P = 0.018) and structural heart disease (67.7 vs. 43.5%, P = 0.011).Despite a similar AF recurrence rate in DM and no-DM patients (32.3 vs. 22.4%, P= 0.240), the ablation procedure was complicated in 28 patients (11 hematomas,three cardiac tamponades and three strokes) and the incidence of complicationswas significantly higher in DM than in no-DM patients (29.0 vs. 8.2%,respectively, P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that DM was an independentrisk factor for complications occurrence (odd ratio 5.936, 95% confidenceinterval 2.059 to 17.112, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: First catheter ablation of AFprocedure in DM patients was equally efficacious than in no-DM patients.

 Effects of cardioversion of atrial fibrillation on endothelial function inhypertension or diabetes. ," BACKGROUND: Cardioversion (CV) to sinus rhythm corrects endothelial dysfunctionsecondary to atrial fibrillation (AF). As AF often complicates hypertension anddiabetes (disorders associated with impaired endothelial function) the studyprobed whether these comorbidities to AF produced an additive effect and to whatextent CV might be advantageous. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brachial arteryflow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was evaluated before and after CV in 17 lone AFpatients (group 1), 16 patients with AF + hypertension (group 2) and 17 patientswith AF + diabetes type II (group 3), while in supine and head-up tilting (HUT)positions, as this is when endothelial vasodilation is emphasized as acounterbalance to neurogenic vasoconstriction. RESULTS: After 2 weeks, CV ingroup 1 increased (P < 0.01) supine FMD (from 7.22-->9.50%) and restored its HUTpotentiation (from 9.31-->17.22%). In group 2, FMD also improved significantlywith CV (supine from 4.92-->7.11% and HUT from 5.29-->11.83%; P < 0.01). In group3, CV did not promote significant FMD changes (supine from 5.12-->4.92% and HUTfrom 4.98-->4.73%). After 3 months, FMD improvement persisted in groups 1 and 2with enduring sinus rhythm, but not in those with AF relapse. In group 3, FMDremained unchanged regardless of cardiac rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: Cardioversionpersistently increases supine shear stress endothelial responsiveness andrestores the orthostatic modulation in AF alone or in association withhypertension, but not with diabetes. Differences in background endothelialimpairment may explain the presence (hypertension) or the absence (diabetes) ofan additive AF effect in comorbidities, as well as CV results. ",no,old
 Endothelial dysfunction and exercise performance in lone atrial fibrillation orassociated with hypertension or diabetes: different results with cardioversion. ," Endothelial dysfunction and underperfusion of exercising muscle contribute toexercise intolerance, hyperventilation, and breathlessness in atrial fibrillation(AF). Cardioversion (CV) improves endothelial function and exercise performance.We examined whether CV is equally beneficial in diabetes and hypertension,diseases that cause endothelial dysfunction and are often associated with AF.Cardiopulmonary exercise and pulmonary and endothelial (brachial arteryflow-mediated dilation) function were tested before and after CV in patients withAF alone (n = 18, group 1) or AF with hypertension (n = 19, group 2) or diabetes(n = 19, group 3). Compared with group 1, peak exercise workload, O2 consumption(Vo2), O2 pulse, aerobic efficiency (Delta Vo2/Delta WR), and ratio of brachialdiameter changes to flow changes (Delta D/Delta F) were reduced in group 2 and,to a greater extent, in group 3; exercise ventilation efficiency (Ve/Vco2 slope)and dead space-to-tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt) were similar among groups. CV hadless effect on peak workload (+7% vs. +18%), peak Vo2 (+12% vs. +17%), O2 pulse(+33% vs. +50%), Delta Vo2/Delta WR (+7% vs. +12%), Ve/Vco2 slope (-6% vs. -12%),Delta D/Delta F (+7% vs. +10%), and breathlessness (Borg scale) in group 2 thanin group 1 and was ineffective in group 3. The antioxidant vitamin C, tested ineight additional patients in each cohort, improved flow-mediated dilation ingroups 1 and 2 before, but not after, CV and was ineffective in group 3,suggesting that the oxidative injury is least in lone AF, greater in hypertensionwith AF, and greater still in diabetes with AF. Comorbidities that impairendothelial activity worsen endothelial dysfunction and exercise intolerance inAF. The advantages of CV appear to be inversely related to the extent of theunderlying oxidative injury. ",no,old

Nonetheless, AF is alsoassociated with vascular disease and hypertension, which are themselvesintimately linked to diabetes. Indeed, the precise pathophysiological andclinical relationships between AF and diabetes mellitus are not completelyunderstood. What we do know is that both diabetes and AF are individually bad forour patients, and the presence of both requires aggressive management strategies. ",no,old

Patients were categorizedas those with hypertension only (n = 597); those with both hypertension and type2 diabetes (n = 171), and those with type 2 diabetes only (n = 147). In thereference population, 824 normotensive subjects without diabetes were identifiedand used as controls. Participants were examined for cardiovascular risk factorsincluding fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, blood pressure, lipids andanthropometric measures. Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded andMinnesota-coded. Insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis modelassessment (HOMA). RESULTS: Age-adjusted prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 2%in patients with hypertension only, 6% in patients with both hypertension andtype 2 diabetes, 4% in patients with type 2 diabetes only and 2% in controls,respectively. Age and sex adjusted odds ratios (OR) (95% CI) were; hypertension0.7 (0.30-1.5), combined hypertension and type 2 diabetes 3.3 (1.6-6.7), and type2 diabetes 2.0 (0.9-4.7). The association with combined hypertension and type 2diabetes remained significant when adjusted for cardiovascular disease (CVD) riskfactors and body mass index (BMI), was attenuated with adjustment for ischemicECG; 2.4 (1.1-5.0) and lost significance with adjustment for insulin resistance;1.3 (0.5-3.1).

 Diabetes influences the cardiac symptoms related to atrial fibrillation. ," It is well known that diabetes mellitus (DM) masks the cardiac symptoms during anischemic heart attack, but there have not been reports of whether DM influencesthe subjective symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AF). The present studyretrospectively assessed 65 patients who were revealed to be in sinus rhythm attheir first visit to hospital and who had experienced episodes of AF (orparoxysmal AF) during the follow-up period. Compared with non-DM cases (n=50), DMpatients (n=15) had a tendency to a more rapid heart rate in sinus rhythm (73+/-4vs 66+/-2, p=0.07) and higher averaged ventricular response at the first-recordedepisode of AF (111+/-7 vs 99+/-3, p=0.10). However, the ratio of symptomaticcases at first-recorded AF tended to be lower in DM cases (33% vs 58%, p=0.08).When patients with beta-blockers or other antiarrhythmic agents were excluded,the ratio of symptomatic patients at first-recorded AF was significantly lower inthe DM cases (25% vs 61%, p=0.04), although there was not a significantdifference in averaged ventricular response at first-recorded AF (112+/-8 vs106+/-5). The prevalence of DM neuropathy was significantly higher inasymptomatic patients (70% vs 0%, p=0.01). DM may mask the cardiac symptoms ofthe first-recorded episode of AF, possibly because of DM neuropathy. ",no,old

METHODS: We used national hospital discharge data toselect all patients discharged from hospital after AF. We focused our analysis onpatients with AF in the primary diagnosis field. Discharges were grouped bydiabetes status (diabetic or non-diabetic). Incidence was calculated overall andstratified by diabetes status. We analyzed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures,patient comorbidities, CHA2DS2-VASc score, length of hospital stay andin-hospital mortality (IHM). RESULTS: We identified a total of 214,457 admissionsfor AF (21.1% with T2DM). The incidence was higher among people with T2DM. Womenwith T2DM have significant higher incidence than men in all years studied. T2DMwas positively associated with AF hospitalization (IRR 3.76, 95%CI 3.72-3.80).T2DM patients were significantly older than patients without diabetes, had morecomorbidity and had higher values of CHA2DS2-VASc score. Prevalence ofdyslipidemia and hypertension were almost 50% higher and prevalence of obesitywas two times higher (all p values<0.05). Diabetes was not associated with ahigher IHM (OR: 0.99, 95%CI 0.93-1.06).

METHODS: ECG data were available from 8273/11,247 participants of AusDiabstudy in 1999/2000 and from 5422 participants in 2004/2005. Minnesota coding wasused to identify prevalent and incident cases of AF. RESULTS: 90 prevalent casesof AF (14.1 per 1000) comprising 56 men (mean age 70.5 +/- 1.9 years) and 34women (aged 78.3 +/- 1.2 years) were identified in 1999-2000. AF prevalence wasassociated with sedentary behaviour versus physically active (PR 2.0, 95% CI1.2-3.6). 53 incident cases of AF (2.0, 95%, CI 1.5-2.6 per 1000 person-year)were subsequently identified in 2004-2005. Increased risk of incident AF wasassociated with male sex, obesity, history of angina, myocardial infarction andstroke. Both increased weight gain and increased weight loss appeared to beassociated with increased risks of developing AF in women, while no obviousassociation was observed in men. Despite their high risk for stroke,anti-thrombotic therapy was observed in only 39.3% of participants withCHA2DS2-VASC scores >/= 2. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to a betterunderstanding of the AF burden. With the ageing population, coordinated effortswill be needed to anticipate the future health care costs related to AF and itsimpacts on the health care system. This will include appropriate application ofanti-thrombotic therapy according to risk of thrombo-embolic events. ",yes,old
 Risk of atrial fibrillation in diabetes mellitus: A nationwide cohort study. ," AIM: Diabetes has been associated with atrial fibrillation but the currentevidence is conflicting. In particular knowledge regarding young diabetespatients and the risk of developing atrial fibrillation is sparse. The aim of ourstudy was to investigate the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients withdiabetes compared to the background population in Denmark. METHODS AND RESULTS:Through Danish nationwide registries we included persons above 18 years of ageand without prior atrial fibrillation and/or diabetes from 1996 to 2012. Thestudy cohort was divided into a background population without diabetes and adiabetes group. The absolute risk of developing atrial fibrillation wascalculated and Poisson regression models adjusted for sex, age and comorbiditieswere used to calculate incidence rate ratios of atrial fibrillation. The totalstudy cohort included 5,081,087 persons, 4,827,713 (95%) in the backgroundpopulation and 253,374 (5%) in the diabetes group. Incidence rates of atrialfibrillation per 1000 person years were stratified in four age groups from 18 to39, 40 to 64, 65 to 74 and 75 to 100 years giving incidence rates (95% confidenceintervals) of 0.02 (0.02-0.02), 0.99 (0.98-1.01), 8.89 (8.81-8.98) and 20.0(19.9-20.2) in the background population and 0.13 (0.09-0.20), 2.10 (2.00-2.20),8.41 (8.10-8.74) and 20.1 (19.4-20.8) in the diabetes group, respectively. Theadjusted incidence rate ratios in the diabetes group with the backgroundpopulation as reference were 2.34 (1.52-3.60), 1.52 (1.47-1.56), 1.20 (1.18-1.23)and 0.99 (0.97-1.01) in the four age groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Diabetesis an independent risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation/flutter, mostpronounced in young diabetes patients. Routine screening for atrialfibrillation/flutter in diabetes patients might be beneficial and havetherapeutic implications, especially in younger diabetes patients. TRANSLATIONALPERSPECTIVE: Diabetes increases the risk of developing atrial fibrillation andespecially young diabetes patients have a high relative risk.

Amultivariable Cox proportional-hazards-regression model was used to estimate thehazard ratio (HR) for first hospitalization for AF and for clinical outcomes.RESULTS: Out of 9,061,258 residents, 285,428 (3.14%) DM subjects were identified,mean age 65.8+/-15 years, 49% were women. The cumulative incidence of AF in DMwas 10.4% vs. 7.4% in non-DM. DM was a risk factor for AF (HR 1.32, 95% CI1.30-1.34; p<0.0001). Oral anticoagulants were prescribed in 34.8% of DM patientswith AF. DM associated with AF, presented the highest HR for stroke: 2.63; 95% CI2.47-2.80 and for total death, HR 2.41; 95% CI 2.36-2.47. CONCLUSIONS: In thispopulation study, DM was an independent risk factor for AF hospitalization. DMpatients with AF had the highest risk of stroke and total mortality. Earlyidentification of AF and a structured plan to optimize the comprehensivemanagement of DM and AF patients is mandatory. ",yes,old
 Hyperuricemia is associated with an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillationin hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. ," PURPOSE: Hyperuricemia/gout and atrial fibrillation (AF) are two pathologicalconditions that are highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes and share multiplecardiovascular risk factors. However, the relationship between elevated levels ofserum uric acid and risk of AF in type 2 diabetes is currently poorly known.METHODS: We studied a hospital-based sample of 842 (male/female = 463/379)patients with type 2 diabetes discharged from our Division of Endocrinologyduring 2007-2011. Hyperuricemia was defined as a serum uric acid level >7 mg/dlfor men and >6 mg/dl for women or allopurinol use. The diagnosis of AF wasconfirmed in affected participants on the basis of ECGs and medical history byexperienced cardiologists. RESULTS: Overall, 243 (28.9 %) patients hadhyperuricemia and 91 (10.8 %) patients had persistent or permanent AF. Comparedwith those with normal serum uric acid levels, patients with hyperuricemia had aremarkably greater prevalence of AF (20.6 vs. 7.1 %; p < 0.001). Hyperuricemiawas significantly associated with an increased risk of prevalent AF (odds ratio3.41, 95 % CI 2.19-5.32; p < 0.001). Adjustments for age, sex, smoking,hemoglobin A1c, hypertension status, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructivepulmonary disease and previous histories of hyperthyroidism, ischemic heartdisease and valvular heart diseases did not weaken this association(adjusted-odds ratio 6.27, 95 % CI 1.82-21.5; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Theseresults indicate that hyperuricemia is associated with an increased prevalence ofAF in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes, independently of multiple riskfactors and potential confounders.

 Impact of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) on development of atrial fibrillationin people with Type 2 diabetes. ," AIMS: To examine if a simple biomarker can identify people with diabetes who areat high risk of atrial fibrillation. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study wasconducted at a single centre in people with Type 2 diabetes referred to ourdepartment between January 2000 and December 2007. In 517 consecutive peoplewithout any history, signs or symptoms of atrial fibrillation at baseline, theassociation between baseline B-type natriuretic peptide level and future atrialfibrillation incidence was examined, with adjustments for other potentiallyconfounding factors. RESULTS: A total of 28 people were diagnosed with new-onsetatrial fibrillation during a median 6-year follow-up. When people werecategorized into three groups according to B-type natriuretic peptide clinicalthresholds (20 and 100 pg/ml), hazard ratios for the development of atrialfibrillation in the middle and highest B-type natriuretic peptide groups were 2.8and 9.4, respectively, compared with the lowest B-type natriuretic peptide group.Time-dependent receiver-operating curve analysis identified a threshold forB-type natriuretic peptide to detect atrial fibrillation development of 52.8pg/ml (sensitivity 75.2%, specificity 68.8%). The B-type natriuretic peptidepredictive value was independent of and similar to that of left atrial size andventricular dimension. CONCLUSION: In people with Type 2 diabetes, high baselineB-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly associated with futureatrial fibrillation development. ",yes,old
 Risk factors for atrial fibrillation in type 2 diabetes: report from the SwedishNational Diabetes Register (NDR). ," AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is more frequent in patients withdiabetes than in the general population. However, characteristics contributing toAF risk in diabetes remain speculative. METHODS: Observational study of 83,162patients with type 2 diabetes, aged 30-79 years, with no baseline AF, 17% hadhistory of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 3.3% history of congestive heartfailure (CHF), followed up for development of AF during mean 6.8 years from2005-2007 to 2012. A subgroup of 67,780 patients without history of CVD or CHFwas also analysed. RESULTS: Using Cox regression, cardiovascular risk factorsassociated with risk for AF were updated mean BMI (HR 1.31 per 5 kg/m(2)) orobesity (HR 1.51), updated mean systolic BP (SBP; HR 1.13 per 10 mmHg) orhypertension (HR 1.71), and cumulative microalbuminuria (HR 1.21), p < 0.001 forall analyses. Male sex, increasing age and height were also significantpredictors. HRs were 1.76 for a history of CHF and 2.56 for in-study CHF, while1.32 for history of CVD and 1.38 for in-study CHD (p < 0.001). Among patientswithout history of CVD or CHF, significant predictors were similarly BMI, SBP,and cumulative microalbuminuria and CHF. The risk of AF differed in the subgroupsachieving or not achieving a target BP < 140/85 mmHg. The HRs for AF were (per 10mmHg increase) 0.88 and 1.24, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Themodifiable risk factors high BP, high BMI and albuminuria were stronglyassociated with AF in type 2 diabetes. CVD, advancing age and height were alsoassociated with AF in type 2 diabetes. ",yes,old
" Body weight and risk of atrial fibrillation in 7,169 patients with newlydiagnosed type 2 diabetes; an observational study. "," BACKGROUND: Obesity, type 2 diabetes and atrial fibrillation (AF) are closelyassociated, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We aimed toexplore associations between body mass index (BMI) or weight change with risk ofAF in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 7,169 participationswith newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were stratified according to baseline BMI,and after a second BMI measurement within 18 months, further grouped according torelative weight change as ""weight gain"" (>1 BMI unit), ""stable weight"" (+/- 1 BMIunit) and ""weight loss"" (<1 BMI unit). The mean follow-up period was 4.6 years,and the risk of AF was estimated using adjusted Cox regression models. RESULTS:Average age at diabetes diagnosis was 60 years and the patients were slightlyobese (mean BMI 30.2 kg/m(2)). During follow-up, 287 patients developed incidentAF, and those with overweight or obesity at baseline had 1.9-fold and 2.9-foldhigher risk of AF, respectively, than those with normal BMI. The 14% of thepatients with subsequent weight gain had 1.5-fold risk of AF compared with thosewith stable weight or weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with newly diagnosedtype 2 diabetes, baseline overweight and obesity, as well as modest weightincrease during the first 18 months after diagnosis, were associated with asubstantially increased risk of incident AF. Patients with type 2 diabetes maybenefit from efforts to prevent weight gain in order to reduce the risk ofincident AF. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01121315. ",yes,old
 Type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk of incident atrial fibrillation in women. ," OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess whether changes of majoratrial fibrillation (AF) risk factors and/or intercurrent cardiovascular eventscould explain the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) andincident AF. BACKGROUND: Previous studies found an increased risk of incident AFamong individuals with T2D, but few, if any, of these studies took into accountchanges of AF risk factors over time. METHODS: A total of 34,720 female healthprofessionals who participated in the Women's Health Study, and who were free ofcardiovascular disease and AF at baseline were followed for a median of 16.4years. Cox proportional-hazards models were constructed to assess therelationship between T2D and incident AF, using either information at baseline ortime-varying covariates for both T2D and potential confounders. RESULTS: Atbaseline, 937 (2.7 %) women had T2D. Compared with women without T2D, women withT2D had an age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for new-onset AF of 1.95 (95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.49 to 2.56; p<0.0001). In multivariable analysesadjusting for baseline confounders, this HR was substantially attenuated, butbaseline T2D remained a significant predictor of incident AF (HR: 1.37, 95% CI:1.03 to 1.83; p=0.03). In time-updated models that adjusted for changes in AFrisk factors and intercurrent cardiovascular events, the HR for T2D wasattenuated further and became nonsignificant (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.40;p=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Although this study confirms a significant relationshipbetween baseline T2D and incident AF, our data suggest that the increased riskassociated with T2D is mainly mediated by changes of other AF risk factors.

" Association of body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and blood pressure levelswith risk of permanent atrial fibrillation. "," BACKGROUND: After an initial episode of atrial fibrillation (AF), AF may recurand become permanent. AF progression is associated with higher morbidity andmortality. Understanding the risk factors for permanent AF could help identifypeople who would benefit most from interventions. OBJECTIVE: To determine whetherbody mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, and blood pressure levels areassociated with permanent AF among people whose initial AF episode terminated.DESIGN: Population-based inception cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Enrollees in GroupHealth, an integrated health care system, aged 30-84 with newly diagnosed AF in2001-2004, whose initial AF terminated within 6 months and who had at least 6months of subsequent follow-up (N = 1,385). MAIN MEASURES: Clinicalcharacteristics were determined from medical records. Permanent AF was determinedfrom medical records and ECG and administrative databases. Permanent AF wasdefined as AF present on two separate occasions 6-36 months apart, without anydocumented sinus rhythm between the two occasions. Cox proportional hazardsmodels were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). KEY RESULTS: Five-yearcumulative incidence of permanent AF was 24 %. Compared with normal BMI(18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), BMI levels of 25.0-29.9 (overweight), 30.0-34.9 (obese 1),35.0-39.9 (obese 2), and >/= 40.0 kg/m(2) (obese 3) were associated with HRs ofpermanent AF of 1.26 (95 % CI: 0.92, 1.72); 1.35 (0.96, 1.91); 1.50 (0.97, 2.33);and 1.79 (1.13, 2.84), adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, bloodpressure, coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, heart failure, andprior stroke. Diabetes, hypertension, and blood pressure were not associated withpermanent AF. CONCLUSIONS: For people whose initial AF episode terminates,benefits of having lower BMI may include a lower risk of permanent AF. Risk ofpermanent AF was similar for people with and without diabetes or hypertension andacross blood pressure levels. ",yes,old
" Type 2 diabetes, glucose homeostasis and incident atrial fibrillation: theAtherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. "," BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes has been inconsistently associated with the risk ofatrial fibrillation (AF) in previous studies that have frequently been beset bymethodological challenges. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: TheAtherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. PARTICIPANTS: Detailed medicalhistories were obtained from 13 025 participants. Individuals were categorised ashaving no diabetes, pre-diabetes or diabetes based on the 2010 American DiabetesAssociation criteria at study baseline (1990-2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosesof incident AF were obtained to the end of 2007. Associations between type 2diabetes and markers of glucose homeostasis and the incidence of AF wereestimated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for possibleconfounders. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes was associated with a significant increasein the risk of AF (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.60) after adjustment forconfounders. There was no indication that individuals with pre-diabetes or thosewith undiagnosed diabetes were at increased risk of AF compared with thosewithout diabetes. A positive linear association was observed between HbA1c andthe risk of AF in those with and without diabetes (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.20)and HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15 per 1% point increase, respectively). There wasno association between fasting glucose or insulin in those without diabetes, buta significant association with fasting glucose was found in those with thecondition. The results were similar in white subjects and African-Americans.CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, HbA1c level and poor glycaemic control are independentlyassociated with an increased risk of AF, but the underlying mechanisms governingthe relationship are unknown and warrant further investigation.

 Meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies of type 2 diabetes mellitus andrisk of atrial fibrillation. ," Atrial fibrillation (AF) is 1 of the most clinically diagnosed cardiacdisturbances but little is known about its risk factors. Previous epidemiologicstudies have reported on the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) andsubsequent risk of AF, with inconsistent results. The aim of this study was toconduct a meta-analysis of published studies to reliably determine the directionand magnitude of any association between DM and AF. A systematic review andmeta-analysis was conducted. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identifyprospective cohort and case-control studies that had reported on the associationbetween DM and other measurements of glucose homeostasis with incident AF byApril 2010. Studies conducted in primarily high-risk populations and participantsin randomized controlled trials were excluded. Seven prospective cohort studiesand 4 case-control studies with information on 108,703 cases of AF in 1,686,097subjects contributed to this analysis. The summary estimate indicated thatpatients with DM had an approximate 40% greater risk of AF compared to unaffectedpatients (relative risk [RR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10 to 1.75, pfor heterogeneity <0.001). After correcting for publication bias, the RR was 1.34(1.07 to 1.68). Studies that had adjusted for multiple risk factors reported asmaller effect estimate compared to age-adjusted studies (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to1.44, vs 1.70, 1.29 to 2.22, p for heterogeneity = 0.053). Thepopulation-attributable fraction of AF owing to DM was 2.5% (95% CI 0.1 to 3.9).In conclusion, DM is associated with an increased risk of subsequent AF but themechanisms that may underpin the relation between DM and AF remain speculative.

 The link between diabetes and atrial fibrillation: cause or correlation? ,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia in the world. As the population ages, it is estimated that the prevalence of AF will increase by 2.5 fold in the next 50 years.1 At the same time, diabetes has become a pandemic disease in the western world as well as in developing countries. Independent risk factors for chronic AF include hypertension, heart failure, valvular heart disease and cardiomyopathy. The development of AF is likely to be multifactorial and the mechanism is elusive, while there is emerging evidence on the correlation between AF and diabetes mellitus (DM). DM and AF share common antecedents such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and obesity. Population-based studies suggested that DM is an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation.2 Both DM and AF are marked predictor for stroke and mortality. The causal relation between DM and AF is still debatable and will be discussed.",yes,old
 Independent contribution of diabetes to increased prevalence and incidence ofatrial fibrillation. ," OBJECTIVE: Diabetes has long been recognized as a risk factor for atrialfibrillation, but its independent contribution to atrial fibrillation has notbeen fully evaluated. We sought to compare the prevalence and incidence of atrialfibrillation in age- and sex-matched patients with and without type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using an observational cohort design, we selected10,213 members of an HMO diabetes registry as of 1 January 1999 plus 7,159patients who entered the registry by 31 December 2004 and matched them topatients without diabetes on year of birth and sex. All patients were followeduntil they died, left the health plan, or until 31 December 2008. We compared thebaseline prevalence of atrial fibrillation and then followed patients withoutatrial fibrillation to compare atrial fibrillation incidence while controllingfor known risk factors. RESULTS: Atrial fibrillation prevalence was significantlygreater among patients with diabetes (3.6 vs. 2.5%, P < 0.0001). Over a meanfollow-up of 7.2 +/- 2.8 years, diabetic patients without atrial fibrillation atbaseline developed atrial fibrillation at an age- and sex-adjusted rate of 9.1per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.6-9.7) compared with a rate of 6.6 (6.2-7.1)among nondiabetic patients. After full adjustment for other risk factors,diabetes was associated with a 26% increased risk of atrial fibrillation amongwomen (hazard ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.08-1.46]), but diabetes was not astatistically significant factor among men (1.09 [0.96-1.24]). CONCLUSIONS: Inthis population, diabetes was an independent determinant of atrial fibrillationprevalence but predicted incidence only among women. These findings havepotential public health implications and emphasize the need for furtherinvestigation of the mechanistic links between diabetes and atrial fibrillation. ",yes,old
 Impact of new-onset diabetes mellitus on development of atrial fibrillation andheart failure in high-risk hypertension (from the VALUE Trial). ," Hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) are known risk factors for atrialfibrillation (AF). We investigated the influence of new-onset DM on developing AFin the VALUE trial population of high-risk hypertensive patients. Five thousandtwo hundred fifty patients of the 15,245 participants in the VALUE trial had DMat baseline and 1,298 of the initially nondiabetic patients developed DM duringthe average 4.2-year follow-up. The presence of AF was determined by centralanalyzed electrocardiograms at baseline and changes were assessed yearly.Patients without AF at baseline and with any AF by later electrocardiograms weredefined as patients with new-onset AF. Patients with new-onset and baseline DMwere compared with patients without DM by a Cox regression model with adjustmentfor prespecified covariates. Five hundred fifty-one patients developed new-onsetAF during the trial. Patients with new-onset DM had a significantly higher eventrate of new-onset AF with a hazard ratio of 1.49 (1.14 to 1.94, p = 0.0031)compared with patients without DM, and there was a trend toward more AF inpatients with DM at baseline. Patients with new-onset DM had also more persistentAF (hazard ratio 1.87, 1.28 to 2.74, p = 0.0014). Patients with new-onset DM andAF had a hazard ratio of 3.56 for heart failure (2.86 to 4.44, p <0.0001)compared with patients with new-onset DM without AF. In conclusion, hypertensivepatients who developed DM during the VALUE trial had more AF than did patientswithout DM, and this may explain some of their concomitant high risk ofhospitalization for heart failure.

" Diabetes mellitus is a strong, independent risk for atrial fibrillation andflutter in addition to other cardiovascular disease. "," BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis.There is a controversy in literature about correlation between DM and atrialfibrillation. The goal of this study was to evaluate DM as a risk factor foratrial fibrillation or flutter using a very large database. METHOD: Patienttreatment files (PTF) containing discharge diagnoses were utilized using ICD-9codes of inpatient treatment from Veterans Health Administration Hospitals (VAH).Patients with type II DM (ICD-9 code 250.0) (293,124) discharged from the VAHbetween 1990 and 2000. Non-matched controls without DM but with hypertension(552,624) were selected from the same PTF. By using multi-variate logisticregressions, the occurrence of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, CHF, CAD andLVH was compared. RESULTS: Atrial fibrillations occurred in 43,674 (14.9%) DMpatients vs. 57,077 (10.3%) in the control group (p<0.0001). Atrial flutteroccurred in 11,852 (4%) of DM patients vs. 13,554 (2.5%) of the control group(p<0.0001). Using multi-variant analysis, DM remained independently associatedwith atrial fibrillation with an OR of 2.13, (95% CI: 2.10 to 2.16; p<0.0001) andflutter (OR 2.20, CI: 2.15 to 2.26; p<0.0001).

To our knowledge, the independentassociation between type 1 diabetes and atrial fibrillation has not been studied.METHODS: We did a prospective case-control study of individuals with type 1diabetes in the Swedish National Diabetes Registry who were each matched withfive controls for age, sex, and county of residence who were randomly selectedfrom the Swedish Population Register. Cases of atrial fibrillation were obtainedfrom the Swedish National Patient Registry. FINDINGS: We followed up 36 258patients with type 1 diabetes and 179 980 controls between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec31, 2013. Median follow-up was 9.7 years (IQR 5.2-13.0) for patients and 10.2years (5.7-13.0) for controls. 749 (2%) individuals with type 1 diabetes and 2882(2%) controls were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, with an adjusted hazardratio (HR) of 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.25; p=0.029) in men and 1.50 (1.30-1.72;p<0.0001) in women (p=0.0019 for interaction). The excess risk of atrialfibrillation in individuals with type 1 diabetes increased with worseningglycaemic control and renal complications. Among individuals withnormoalbuminuria, no excess risk of atrial fibrillation was noted in men withtype 1 diabetes who had HbA1c lower than 9.7% (<83 mmol/mol) or in women withtype 1 diabetes who had HbA1c lower than 8.8% (<73 mmol/mol). INTERPRETATION:Compared with the general population, the risk of atrial fibrillation in men withtype 1 diabetes was slightly raised, whereas for female patients it was 50%higher. The risk of atrial fibrillation in people with type 1 diabetes increasedwith renal complications and poor glycaemic control.

Importantly, diabetes is well established as a risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease, including atrial fibrillation.1 Not only is diabetes associated with the development of atrial fibrillation, it is also a potent risk factor for stroke and thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.2 This higher stroke risk is related to the duration of diabetes, which might be more important than glycaemic control per se.",no,new
 Hyperuricemia is associated with an increased prevalence of paroxysmal atrialfibrillation in patients with type 2 diabetes referred for clinically indicated24-h Holter monitoring. ," PURPOSE: Several studies have reported an association between hyperuricemia andincreased risk of permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with and withouttype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Currently, no published data are available onthe relationship between hyperuricemia and risk of paroxysmal AF. METHODS: Weretrospectively evaluated 245 T2DM outpatients without pre-existing AF, cancer,cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease, who underwent a 24-h ECG-Holter monitoringfor various clinical indications. Hyperuricemia was defined as a serum uric acidlevel >7 mg/dl for men and >6 mg/dl for women or allopurinol use. The diagnosisof paroxysmal AF was confirmed in affected individuals on the basis of 24-hECG-Holter monitoring by experienced cardiologists. RESULTS: Hyperuricemia wasobserved in 59 (24.1%) patients, whereas paroxysmal AF was found in 11 (4.5%)patients. The prevalence of paroxysmal AF was higher in patients withhyperuricemia than in those without hyperuricemia (10.2 vs. 2.7%, p = 0.026).Logistic regression analysis showed that hyperuricemia was associated with anincreased risk of prevalent paroxysmal AF. This association remained significanteven after adjustment for age, metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease(adjusted-odds ratio 4.01, 95% CI 1.08-14.9; p = 0.039). Similar results werefound when we used serum uric acid levels as a continuous measure. CONCLUSIONS:This study shows for the first time that hyperuricemia is independentlyassociated with an approximately fourfold increased risk of prevalent paroxysmalAF in patients with T2DM. These findings may partly explain the increased risk ofpermanent atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular death observed among patientswith hyperuricemia. ",no,new
 Considerations and treatment options for patients with comorbid atrialfibrillation and diabetes mellitus. ," INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are commonworldwide and their incidence is increasing, representing a significant publichealth and economic burden as well as an increase in individual increasedmorbidity and mortality risk profiles.

Themultifactorial interplay between these conditions requires individual assessmentof patient risk profiles with the aim of minimising the impact of each modifiablerisk factor. ",yes,new
 Pioglitazone attenuates atrial remodeling and vulnerability to atrialfibrillation in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. ," BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recent evidence indicates that peroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptor (PPAR)-gamma activators exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidantactions. However, the underlying mechanisms by which these agents prevent atrialremodeling in diabetes are not completely elucidated. We sought to investigatethe potential effects of pioglitazone, a PPAR-gamma activator, on atrialremodeling and atrial fibrillation (AF) inducibility in diabetic rabbits.METHODS: Alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits were randomly divided into threegroups: diabetes only, diabetes treated with low-dose pioglitazone (4 mg/day/kg),or diabetes treated with high dose pioglitazone (8 mg/day/kg) (n = 24 for eachgroup). A total of 24 healthy rabbits serving as controls. Eight weeks later,hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and electrophysiological parameters wererecorded. Left atrial whole-cell patch-clamp studies, histological examinationand western-blot analysis were also performed. RESULTS: In the DM group (6/8 vs.1/8, P < 0.05), higher AF inducibility, increased amount of fibrosis, lower INa ,and higher ICaL were observed in the DM group compared to controls. Western-blotanalysis showed that DM increased the expression of extracellularsignal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), phosphorylation ERK (pERK), transforming growthfactor beta 1 (TGFbeta1), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappaB p50(NF-kappaB p50), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). All of theseelectrophysiological, histological, ion current density and protein expressionchanges were all reduced by pioglitazone. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone attenuatesdiabetes-induced structural and electrophysiological remodeling in the atria,thereby reducing the vulnerability to AF.

However, given the large number of subgroups analyzed raising the possibility of type 1 error and the lack of a prespecified hypothesis or mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneity of comparative bleeding effects by diabetes observed with apixaban in the ARISTOTLE trial,3 we believe that this observation should be interpreted cautiously as hypothesis generating. Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of data from the pivotal NOAC trials,6 the risks of major bleeding with NOAC vs warfarin in patients with vs without diabetes were not statistically different (interaction, P?=?.12).",no,new

The present subanalysis aimed to clarify the efficacyof combined use of warfarin and statins in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF)with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), or hypertension. Theeffects of adding statins to warfarin were compared with those of warfarin alonein patients with NVAF with the data set of J-RHYTHM Registry, a prospective,observational study with a 2-year follow-up. End points included thromboembolism,major hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Of 7,406patients with NVAF and follow-up data, 6,404 patients received warfarin atbaseline. Of these, 1,605 patients also received a statin. Patients in thewarfarin plus statin group showed significantly lower all-cause mortalitycompared with those on warfarin alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% confidenceinterval [CI] 0.38 to 0.87, p = 0.0089), although thromboembolic event rates didnot differ significantly (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.20, p = 0.21). In contrast,in 1,223 patients with DM, the warfarin plus statin group showed significantlylower thromboembolic event rates than the warfarin-alone group (HR 0.33, 95% CI0.11 to 0.96, p = 0.041). Interestingly, in patients with coronary artery diseaseor with hypertension, the addition of statin to warfarin did not decrease thefrequency of thromboembolic events. In conclusion, in Japanese patients with NVAFwith DM, a combination of warfarin and a statin could be clinically beneficialfor preventing thromboembolic events. ",no,new
 Effect of ramipril/hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril/canrenone combination onatrial fibrillation recurrence in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with andwithout cardiac autonomic neuropathy. ," INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare the effect oframipril/canrenone versus ramipril/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination onatrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence in type 2 diabetic hypertensives with andwithout cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 289hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, 95 with CAN, in sinus rhythm but with atleast two episodes of AF in the previous 6 months were randomized to ramipril 5mg plus canrenone 50 mg (titrated to 10/100 mg) or to ramipril 5 mg plus HCTZ12.5 mg (titrated to 10/25 mg) or to amlodipine 5 mg (titrated to 10 mg) for 1year. Clinic blood pressure (BP) and a 24-h ECG were evaluated monthly. Patientswere asked to report any episode of symptomatic AF and to perform an ECG as earlyas possible. Serum procollagen type I carboxy-terminal peptide (PIP) andcarboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP) were evaluated before andafter each treatment period. RESULTS: Blood pressure was similarly andsignificantly reduced by all treatments. A total of 51% of patients withamlodipine had a recurrence of AF, as did 31% of patients with ramipril/HCTZ (p <0.05 vs. amlodipine) and 13% of patients with ramipril/canrenone (p < 0.01 vs.amlodipine and p < 0.05 vs. ramipril/HCTZ). A similar trend was found in diabeticpatients with CAN. Both combinations reduced PIP and increased CITP, but theeffects of ramipril/canrenone were significantly more marked. CONCLUSIONS: Thesefindings suggest that in type 2 diabetic hypertensives, ramipril/canrenonetreatment was more effective than ramipril/HCTZ in reducing AF recurrence. Thiscould be related to the greater improvement in cardiac fibrosis. ",no,new
 Women with atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes have a higher incidence ofhospitalization and undergo ablation or pacemaker implantation less frequentlythan men. ," BACKGROUND: We reviewed trends from 2004 to 2013 in the incidence and outcomesfor atrial fibrillation (AF) in Spanish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) comparing women and men. METHODS: We used national hospital discharge dataincluding all T2DM patients discharged from the hospital after AF. Patients withAF in the primary diagnosis field were selected. Discharges were grouped by sex.Incidence was calculated overall and stratified by sex. We analyzed diagnosticand therapeutic procedures, patient comorbidities, CHA2DS2-VASc score, length ofhospital stay, readmission rates and in-hospital mortality (IHM). RESULTS: Weidentified a total of 214,457 admissions for AF. Patients with T2DM accounted for21.1% (19,505 men and 25,954 women). Women with T2DM had a significantly higherincidence of AF compared to men over the study period (IRR 1.33;95%CI 1.31-1.35).Women were significantly older (77.24+/-8.69years) than men (72.62+/-10.28years),had higher prevalences of obesity and hypertension, and higher CHA2DS2-VAScscore. Women less frequently underwent ablation (3.21% vs. 1.54%; p<0.001) andreceived an implanted pacemaker (14.3% vs. 8.16%; p<0.001) than men. Crude IHMwas 2.81% for women and 2.48% for men (p=0.030). Sex was not associated with ahigher IHM after multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates anincrease in hospitalization for AF in diabetic women. Women were older, had ahigher comorbidity index and had CHAD2DS2-VASc score than men. Women with AF andT2DM undergo ablation or pacemaker implantation less frequently than their malecounterparts. After multivariable adjustment sex did not predict mortality duringadmissions for AF. ",yes,new
" CHA2DS2-VASc Score (Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age >/=75 [Doubled],Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack [Doubled], VascularDisease, Age 65-74, Female) for Stroke in Asian Patients With AtrialFibrillation: A Korean Nationwide Sample Cohort Study. "," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The CHA2DS2-VASc stroke score (congestive heart failure,hypertension, age >/=75 (doubled), diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transientischemic attack (doubled), vascular disease, age 65-74, female) is used in mostguidelines for risk stratification in atrial fibrillation (AF), but most data forthis score have been derived in Western populations. Ethnic differences in strokerisk may be present. Our objective was to investigate risk factors for stroke inAF and application of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in an Asian AF population fromKorea. METHODS: A total of 5855 oral anticoagulant-naive nonvalvular AF patientsaged >/=20 years were enrolled from Korea National Health Insurance ServiceSample cohort from 2002 to 2008 and were followed up until December 2013.RESULTS: The incidence rates (per 100 person-years) of ischemic stroke were 3.32in the total population, being 0.23 in low-risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score 0 [male] or 1[female]) and 4.59 in high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc >/=2). Incidence rates ofischemic stroke or the composite thromboembolism end point showed a clearincrease with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc score. On multivariable analysis,significant associations between CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors and ischemic strokewere observed; however, the significance of vascular disease or diabetes mellituswas attenuated after multivariate adjustment, and female sex (hazard ratio, 0.73;95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.84) had a lower risk of ischemic stroke thanmales. Patients who were categorized as low risk consistently had an event rate<1% per year. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of CHA2DS2-VASc score in Asians iscomparable with that in Western populations. The score shows good performance indefining the truly-low-risk AF patients for stroke/thromboembolism. ",yes,new
" Diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation: evidence of a pathophysiological,clinical and epidemiological association beyond the thromboembolic risk."," A large number of studies have linked diabetes mellitus (DM) to the developmentof cardiovascular disease. However, the association between DM and arrhythmicdisease of the heart is less well recognized by the cardiology community. Mostly,the focus is the increased thromboembolic risk that the presence of DM confers topatients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, recent evidence points toward anincreased prevalence of AF in patients with diabetes. This association seems tobe reinforced by the presence of additional comorbidities such as hypertensionand insulin-resistance. Moreover, different pathophysiological mechanisms supportthis association. Notably the link between AF and DM is bidirectional: not onlypatients with DM are more vulnerable to develop AF but also patients withnew-onset AF have an increased risk of DM. Herein, the epidemiological findingsand pathophysiological mechanisms linking AF and DM will be reviewed in order toincrease the knowledge on this association and improve the clinical andtherapeutic approach.

 Thiazolidinedione use and atrial fibrillation in diabetic patients: ameta-analysis. ," BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that thiazolidinediones (TZDs) mayexert protective effects in atrial fibrillation (AF). The present meta-analysisinvestigated the association between TZD use and the incidence of AF in diabeticpatients. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched until December 2016. Of the346 initially identified records, 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 4observational studies with 130,854 diabetic patients were included in the finalanalysis. RESULTS: Pooled analysis of the included studies demonstrated thatpatients treated with TZDs had approximately 30% lower risk of developing AFcompared to controls [odds ratio (OR): 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62to 0.87, p = 0.0003]. This association was consistently observed for both newonset AF (OR =0.77, p = 0.002) and recurrent AF (OR =0.41, p = 0.002),pioglitazone use (OR =0.56, p = 0.04) but not rosiglitazone use (OR =0.78, p =0.12). The association between TZD use and AF incidence was not significant inthe pooled analysis of three RCTs (OR =0.77, 95% CI = 0.53-1.12, p = 0.17), butwas significantly in the pooled analysis of the four observational studies (OR=0.71, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that TZDs may conferprotection against AF in the setting of diabetes mellitus (DM). This class ofdrugs can be used as upstream therapy for DM patients to prevent the developmentof AF. Further large-scale RCTs are needed to determine whether TZDs use couldprevent AF in the setting of DM. ",no,new

 Preoperative Hemoglobin A1c and the Occurrence of Atrial Fibrillation FollowingOn-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in Type-2 Diabetic Patients. ," BACKGROUND: We investigated the association of the preoperative hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c) with occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in type-2diabetic patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.METHODS: We prospectively studied 708 type-2 diabetes patients [433 men([61.2%)], candidate for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. Biochemistryprofile was measured on the day of operation. All patients were telemonitored for72 hours after operation for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. The role ofHbA1c as a predictor for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation was thenevaluated. RESULTS: A total of 109 (15.3%) patients developed POAF. Patients inthe atrial fibrillation group tended to be older, with prolonged longer diabetes,and have renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension.In the univariable and multivariable regression model, HbA1c was not a predictorfor POAF.

 Insulin-Requiring Versus Noninsulin-Requiring Diabetes and Thromboembolic Risk inPatients With Atrial Fibrillation: PREFER in AF. ," BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a known risk predictor for thromboembolic events inpatients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but no study has explored the prognosticweight of insulin in this setting. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated thedifferential role of insulin versus no insulin therapy on thromboembolic risk inpatients with diabetes and AF. METHODS: We accessed individual patient data fromthe prospective, real-world, multicenter, PREFER in AF (European Prevention ofthromboembolic events-European Registry in Atrial Fibrillation). We compared therates of stroke/systemic embolism at 1 year according to diabetes status (nodiabetes, diabetes without insulin therapy, diabetes on insulin therapy).RESULTS: In an overall population of 5,717 patients, 1,288 had diabetes, 22.4% ofwhom were on insulin. For patients with diabetes who were on insulin, there was asignificantly increased risk of stroke/systemic embolism at 1 year versus eitherno diabetes (5.2% vs. 1.9%; hazard ratio: 2.89; 95% confidence interval: 1.67 to5.02; p = 0.0002) or diabetes without insulin treatment (5.2% vs. 1.8%; hazardratio: 2.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.49 to 5.87; p = 0.0019). Notably, ratesof stroke/embolism were similar in patients with diabetes not receiving insulinversus patients without diabetes (hazard ratio: 0.97; 95% confidence interval:0.58 to 1.61; p = 0.90). The selective predictive role of insulin-requiringdiabetes was independent of potential confounders, including diabetes duration,and was maintained in various subpopulations, including the subgroup receivinganticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of anticoagulated patientswith AF, the sole presence of diabetes not requiring insulin did not imply anincreased thromboembolic risk. Conversely, insulin-requiring diabetes contributedmost, if not exclusively, to the overall increase of thromboembolic risk in AF. ",yes,new
" Atrial Fibrillation, Type 2 Diabetes, and Non-Vitamin K Antagonist OralAnticoagulants: A Review. "," Importance: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and isassociated with a 5-fold increase in the risk for stroke. Type 2 diabetes is anindependent risk factor for both stroke and atrial fibrillation, and in thesetting of AF, type 2 diabetes is independently associated with a 2% to 3.5%increase in absolute stroke rate per year. The overlap in the pathophysiologiesof AF and type 2 diabetes are not well understood, and current practiceguidelines provide few recommendations regarding patients with both conditions.Observations: In this article, we review the epidemiology and pathophysiology ofthe nexus of AF and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we analyze the subgroup ofpatients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of non-vitaminK antagonist oral anticoagulants in prevention of arterial thromboembolism in AF,highlighting the greater absolute benefit of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants inpatients with type 2 diabetes. Finally, we offer recommendations on riskstratification and therapy for patients with concomitant AF and type 2 diabetes.Conclusions and Relevance: We highlight the increased thromboembolic risk withcoexisting AF and type 2 diabetes. We recommend that further studies be done toevaluate the potential benefits of anticoagulation for all patients who have bothand the potential for non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants to have greater benefitsthan risks over vitamin K antagonists.

 Comparison of the Incidence of Major Bleeding With Rivaroxaban Use AmongNonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus. ," Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common co-morbidity in those with nonvalvular atrialfibrillation (NVAF). Most patients with DM and NVAF have a CHA2DS2-VASc score of>/=1 and should be considered for oral anticoagulation therapy for strokeprevention per treatment guidelines. The most important risk associated withanticoagulation is bleeding, which may be higher in those with NVAF plus DM. Ourobjective was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of major bleeding(MB) in rivaroxaban users diagnosed with NVAF, further comparing those with DMversus those without DM, in a real-world clinical setting. Electronic medicalrecords of >10 million patients from the Department of Defense Military HealthSystem were queried to identify rivaroxaban users with NVAF over a 2.5-yearperiod. Major bleeding-related hospitalization was identified by a validatedcase-finding algorithm. Patient characteristics, incidence and management of MB,and fatal outcomes were assessed by DM status. Of 44,793 rivaroxaban users withNVAF, 12,039 (26.9%) had DM, who were more likely men, younger, with moreco-morbidity and higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores. Major bleeding incidence was higheramong those with DM compared with those without, 3.68 (95% confidence interval[CI] 3.37 to 4.03) versus 2.51 (95% CI 2.34 to 2.69) per 100 person-years, andintracranial bleeding incidence was 0.19 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.28) versus 0.25 (95%CI 0.20 to 0.31) per 100 person-years. Fatal outcomes were rare for both cohorts,0.09 per 100 person-years. In conclusion, in this post-marketing study of 44,793rivaroxaban users with NVAF, patients with DM had more co-morbidities and higherincidence of MB compared with those without DM. ",no,new

In this study-levelmeta-analysis, we included 4 randomized phase III trials comparing NOACs andwarfarin in patients with nonvalvular AF; a total of 18 134 patients with DM and40 454 without DM were overall considered. Incidence of the following outcomemeasures was evaluated during the follow-up: stroke or systemic embolism,ischemic stroke, major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and vascular death. Useof NOACs compared with warfarin reduced stroke/systemic embolism in diabetic(Risk Ratios [RR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.93; P = .004) and nondiabetic patients (RR0.83, 0.73-0.93; P = .001) (P for interaction .72).

 Early impairment in left ventricular longitudinal systolic function is associatedwith an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation in patients with type 2diabetes. ," AIMS: It is known that type 2 diabetic patients are at high risk of atrialfibrillation (AF). However, the early echocardiographic determinants of AFvulnerability in this patient population remain poorly known. METHODS: Wefollowed-up for 2years a sample of 180 consecutive outpatients with type 2diabetes, who were free from AF and ischemic heart disease at baseline. Allpatients underwent a baseline echocardiographic-Doppler evaluation with tissueDoppler and 2-D strain analysis. Standard electrocardiograms were performed twiceper year, and a diagnosis of incident AF was confirmed in affected patients by asingle cardiologist. RESULTS: Over the 2-year follow-up period, 14 (7.8%)patients developed incident AF. In univariate analyses, echocardiographicpredictors of new-onset AF were greater indexed cardiac mass, larger indexed leftatrial volume (LAVI), lower global longitudinal strain (LSSYS), lower globaldiastolic strain rate during early phase of diastole (SRE), lower globaldiastolic strain rate during late phase of diastole (SRL), and higher E/SREratio. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lower LSSYS remainedthe only significant predictor of new-onset AF (adjusted-odds ratio 1.63, 95%CI1.17-2.27; p<0.005) after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, indexedcardiac mass and LAVI. Results were unchanged even after adjustment for body massindex, hypertension and glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: This is the firstprospective study to show that early LSSYS impairment independently predicts therisk of new-onset AF in type 2 diabetic patients with preserved ejection fractionand without ischemic heart disease. Future larger prospective studies are neededto confirm these findings. ",no,new
 High plasma level of soluble RAGE is independently associated with a lowrecurrence of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation in diabetic patient. ," AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, andthe receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) pathway is involved ininsulin resistance and cardiac remodelling. We hypothesized that plasma level ofsoluble RAGE (sRAGE) would predict clinical outcome after radiofrequency catheterablation for AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured pre-procedural plasma level ofsRAGE in 496 patients who underwent AF ablation (142 patients with diabetes, 354patients without diabetes selected by matching them with diabetic patientsaccording to age, sex, and AF type). (i) Plasma level of sRAGE was significantlyhigher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics (580.0 +/- 576.4 vs. 435.8 +/-280.7 pg/mL, P = 0.005), but there was no difference in sRAGE levels betweenpatients with clinical recurrence of AF and those without. (ii) During 24.5 +/-18.0 months of follow-up, the recurrence of AF was significantly lower in thediabetic patient group with high sRAGE (>/=418 pg/mL based on the median value)than the diabetic patient group with low sRAGE (log-rank P = 0.045). This wasespecially pronounced in patients with paroxysmal AF and diabetes (log-rank P =0.016), but no association was found in non-diabetics. (iii) In multivariate Coxregression analysis, high sRAGE (HR 0.395, 95% CI 0.175-0.894, P = 0.026) andparoxysmal AF (HR 0.387, 95% CI 0.179-0.835, P = 0.016) were independentlyassociated with the favourable clinical outcome of rhythm control after AFablation in diabetic patients.

Analysis of clinical characteristics and risk of stroke and death within 1 yearof patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation combined with diabetesmellitus. ," OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics and impact of diabetesmellitus (DM) on prognosis in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF).METHODS: Data of nonvalvular AF patients in the Chinese Emergency AtrialFibrillation Registry Study were retrospectively analyzed. The eligible patientswere divided into the DM group and the non-DM group. Uni- and multi-variate Coxregression analysis were used to explore risk factors of 1-year outcomes.RESULTS: A total of 1 644 patients were enrolled in the study with 227 patientscombined with DM (16.8%). Compared with non-DM group, patients with DM were olderand had higher body weight, had higher prevalence of myocardial infarction,coronary heart disease, hypertension and stroke, and were at higher risk ofthromboembolism. The proportion of anticoagulant treatment was low in both groups(10.1% vs 7.4%, P=0.141). Compared with patients without DM, patients with DM hadhigher all-cause mortality (19.5% vs 12.7%, P=0.004), cardiovascular death (10.8%vs 7.02%, P=0.047) and combined end events (CEE, 26.4% vs 2.4%, P=0.023), whilewith comparable incidence of stroke (10.1% vs 7.4%, P=0.141).

 Presence of diabetic microvascular complications does not incrementally increaserisk of ischemic stroke in diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation: Anationwide cohort study. ," Conventional stroke risk prediction tools used in atrial fibrillation (AF)incorporate the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) as a risk factor. However, itis unknown whether this risk is homogenous or dependent on the presence ofdiabetic microvascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy,and neuropathy. The present study examined the risk of ischemic stroke indiabetic patients with and without microvascular complications. The present studyused the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan with detailedhealthcare data on all-comers to the Taiwanese medical system from January 1,1996 to December 31, 2011. AF and DM were identified when listed as dischargediagnoses or confirmed more than twice in the outpatient department. Patients onantithrombotic agents were excluded. The clinical endpoint was ischemic stroke.Among the 50,180 AF patients with DM, the majority had no microvascularcomplications (72.7%), while 2.6% had diabetic retinopathy, 8.4% had diabeticnephropathy, and 16.1% had diabetic neuropathy. Ischemic stroke occurred in 6003patients, with a 4.74% annual risk of ischemic stroke. When compared with DMpatients without microvascular complications, those with diabetic retinopathy,nephropathy, or neuropathy had higher incidences of ischemic stroke (4.65 vs5.07, 4.77, or 5.20 per 100 person-years, respectively). However, after adjustingfor confounding factors, the differences were no longer significant. In a largenationwide AF cohort with DM, risk of ischemic stroke was similar betweenpatients with and without microvascular complications, suggesting that riskstratification of these patients does not require inclusion of diabeticretinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.

 CHA2DS2-VASc score is useful in predicting poor 12-month outcomes followingmyocardial infarction in diabetic patients without atrial fibrillation. ," AIMS: TIMI risk score and GRACE risk model are widely available and acceptedscores for risk assessment in STEMI patients and include predictors of pooroutcomes. CHA2DS2-VASc is a validated score for predicting embolic/stroke risk inpatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Its components contribute to theworse prognosis following myocardial infarction. The advantage of theCHA2DS2-VASc score in comparison with other risk scores is that it provides acomprehensive, fast, and simple method for physicians in risk evaluation thatrequires no calculators or computers. Therefore, we have set out to examine theprognostic significance of CHA2DS2-VASc score following STEMI in diabeticpatients without AF. METHODS: A total of 472 patients with diabetes mellitus andSTEMI undergoing primary PCI were enrolled. Based on the estimated CHA2DS2-VAScscore, the study population was divided into three groups: group 1 (N = 111) witha moderate CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or 3; group 2 (N = 257) with a highCHA2DS2-VASc score of 4 or 5; and group 3 (N = 104) with a very high CHA2DS2-VAScscore of 6 or higher. RESULTS: In diabetic patients with STEMI, the median ofCHA2DS2-VASc score was 4 (interquartile range 3-5). In-hospital mortality ratewas similar across three groups. CHA2DS2-VASc score was not a risk factor ofin-hospital mortality. ROC analysis revealed good diagnostic value ofCHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting long-term mortality (AUC 0.62 95 % CI 0.57-0.66P = 0.0003) and stroke (AUC 0.75 95 % CI 0.71-0.79 P = 0.0003), but no value inpredicting long-term myocardial infarction. CHA2DS2-VASc score was an independentpredictor of 12-month mortality and stroke. One-point increment in CHA2DS2-VAScscore was associated with an increase in the risk of 12-month death by 24 % andfor 12-month stroke by 101 %. CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic patients with STEMI and noprevious AF, median CHA2DS2-VASc score was high (4 points) and predicted 12-monthdeath and stroke. However, it failed to predict in-hospital death and 12-monthMI. CHA2DS2-VASc score had a similar discrimination performance in predicting12-month mortality as TIMI risk score and a better discrimination performance inpredicting 12-month stroke than TIMI risk score. Thus, it can serve as anadditive tool in identifying high-risk patients that require aggressivemanagement. ",no,new

RESULTS:Demographic characteristics of subjects in 1992 (n = 40 255) and 2010 (n = 80314), respectively, were as follows: age 65-74 years, 37% and 32%; age >85 years,20% and 25%; White, 94% and 93%; hypertension, 46% and 80%; diabetes, 20% and32%; and chronic kidney disease, 5% and 18%. Among Medicare AF patients withdiabetes, ischemic stroke decreased by 71% (1992-2010) from 65 to 19 per 1000patient-years; warfarin use increased from 28% to 62%. Among patients withoutdiabetes, ischemic stroke decreased by 68% from 44 to 14 per 1000 patient-years,whereas warfarin use increased from 26% to 59%. Approximately 38% of Medicare AFpatients with diabetes did not receive anticoagulation in 2010. CONCLUSIONS:Ischemic stroke declined and warfarin use increased similarly in Medicarepatients with and without diabetes. Ischemic stroke rates were consistentlyhigher in diabetes patients, validating the inclusion of diabetes in riskcalculators. The population of Medicare patients with diabetes who did notreceive warfarin deserves future attention. ",no,new
 Comparison of dabigatran versus warfarin in diabetic patients with atrialfibrillation: Results from the RE-LY trial. ," OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is frequent among patients with atrialfibrillation (AF). The RE-LY trial permits evaluation of patient characteristics,outcomes and the effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate among diabeticindividuals. METHODS: Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared betweendiabetic and non-diabetic patients and the relative efficacy of each dose ofdabigatran (150 mg bid and 110 mg bid) versus warfarin was evaluated. RESULTS: Of18,113 patients in RE-LY, 4221 patients (23.3%) had DM. Patients with DM wereyounger (70.9 vs. 71.7 years), more likely to have hypertension (86.6% vs.76.5%), coronary artery disease (37.4% vs. 24.9%) and peripheral vascular disease(5.6% vs. 3.2%); (all p<0.01). Time in therapeutic range for warfarin-treatedpatients was 65% for diabetic versus 68% for non-diabetic patients (p<0.001).Regardless of assigned treatment, stroke or systemic embolism was more commonamong patients with DM (1.9% per year vs. 1.3% per year, p<0.001). DM was alsoassociated with an increased risk of death (5.1% per year vs. 3.5% per year,p<0.001) and major bleeding (4.2% per year vs. 3.0% per year, p<0.001). Theabsolute reduction in stroke or systemic embolism with dabigatran compared towarfarin was greater among patients with DM than those without DM (dabigatran 110mg: 0.59% per year vs. 0.05% per year; dabigatran 150 mg: 0.89% per year vs.0.51% per year). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to non-DM patients, AF patients with DMderive a greater absolute risk reduction in embolic events when treated withdabigatran. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00262600.

 Type 2 diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation: From mechanisms to clinicalpractice. ," Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic conditions and itsprevalence has increased continuously over the past decades, primarily due to theobesity epidemic. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent sustained cardiacarrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with increased cardiovascularand cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shown thatpatients with diabetes have an increased risk of AF. However, the results aboutthe relationship between diabetes and AF are still conflicting. Mechanisms thatare responsible for an association between diabetes and AF, as well as theadequate treatment of AF in patients with diabetes, are still insufficientlystudied. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge ofmechanisms that connect AF and diabetes, the clinical studies that includepatients with both conditions, and the treatment options in modern pharmacology.

 Ruptured giant mitral valve aneurysm: an unexpected finding in a diabetic patientwith dyspnea and new-onset atrial fibrillation. ," Mitral valve aneurysm (MVA) is a rare valve disease. The case is reported ofpathologically proven MVA in a 61-year-old diabetic male with chronic alcoholicliver disease who presented with dyspnea and new-onset atrial fibrillation,without clinical elements of current or recent infection. Transthoracicechocardiography revealed a 'cystic' formation of the anterior mitral leaflet(AML) with mild mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) hittingthe AML. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed clearly that the formationon the AML was a valve aneurysm, and depicted the site of aneurysm rupture withan additional jet of MR through the rupture. Following mitral valve replacement,pathology of the excised valve showed chronic bacterial endocarditis withcalcified bacterial colonies, myxomatous changes with fibrinoid dissection oflamina fibrosa, and neovascularization of the leaflet. The mechanisms of MVAformation are discussed, together with its potential complications, diagnosticmodalities and therapeutic strategies. The present case emphasizes that MVA isoften a remnant of endocarditis, even when the latter is clinically silent andundiagnosed. The importance of chronic AR directed towards the AML as apredisposing condition for MVA formation is also underlined in this case. Thesuperiority of TEE in providing a full exploration of the mitral valve morphologyis verified. ",no,new

 Glycated hemoglobin and risk of first episode stroke in diabetic patients withatrial fibrillation: A cohort study. ," BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of stroke in patientswith atrial fibrillation. Whether glycemic control, evaluated by glycatedhemoglobin, affects the risk of stroke in diabetic patients with atrialfibrillation remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association betweenglycated hemoglobin and risk of first episode stroke in diabetic patients withatrial fibrillation. METHODS: By using the computerized database of the largesthealth maintenance organization in Israel, we identified a cohort of adults (age>/=20 years) in whom atrial fibrillation was diagnosed before January 1, 2012.Eligible subjects had no previous stroke or transient ischemic attack and werenot on anticoagulants at baseline. The cohort (37,358 subjects) was followed forthe first episode stroke or transient ischemic attack up to December 31, 2012.RESULTS: A total of 1052 subjects had stroke during 35,278 person-years offollow-up (stroke rate 2.98 per 100 person-years). Cox proportional hazardsregression analysis adjusting for CHA2DS2-VASc score risk factors revealed thatcompared with subjects without diabetes, the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.04(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-1.30) for the lowest glycated hemoglobinquartile (<6.35%), 1.14 (95% CI 0.92-1.42) for the second quartile (6.35%-6.90%),1.46 (95% CI 1.19-1.79) for the third quartile (>6.90%-7.70%), and 1.63 (95% CI1.33-2.00) for the highest quartile(>7.70%) (for trend, P < .001). In diabeticpatients (n = 11,176), the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.17 (95% CI 1.09-1.26)for every 1% increment in glycated hemoglobin level. The area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve was 0.585 for the CHA2DS2-VASc score, whichincreased to 0.604 when glycated hemoglobin was included in the model (P = .038).CONCLUSION: Glycated hemoglobin is directly associated with stroke risk, and itimproves the predictive accuracy for stroke in diabetic patients with atrialfibrillation.

 Clinical characteristics and impact of diabetes mellitus on outcomes in patientswith nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. ," PURPOSE: Studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor forcardiovascular disease, including atrial fibrillation (AF); however, the clinicalcharacteristics and prognostic impact of DM in patients with nonvalvular AF havenot been well understood in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Included were 1644consecutive patients with nonvalvular AF. Endpoints included all-cause mortality,cardiovascular mortality, stroke, major bleeding, and combined endpoint events(CEE) during a 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: The prevalence of DM was 16.8% innonvalvular AF patients. Compared with non-diabetic AF patients, diabetic AFpatients were older and tended to coexist with other cardiovascular diseases.Most patients with DM (93.5%) were eligible for anticoagulation, as determined byCHADS2 scores. However, only 11.2% of patients received anticoagulation. During a1-year follow-up, the all-cause mortality and CEE rate in the DM group weresignificantly higher than those of the non-DM group, while the incidence ofstroke was comparable. After multivariate adjustments, DM was still anindependent risk factor for 1-year all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR)=1.558;95% confidence interval (CI) 1.126-2.156; p=0.007], cardiovascular mortality(HR=1.615; 95% CI 1.052-2.479; p=0.028), and CEE (HR=1.523; 95% CI 1.098-2.112;p=0.012), yet not for stroke (HR=1.119; 95% CI 0.724-1.728; p=0.614). CONCLUSION:DM is a common morbidity coexisting with nonvalvular AF and is associated with anincreased risk of 1-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and CEE.However, no increased risk of stroke was found during a 1-year follow-up inpatients with AF and DM.

 The impact of associated diabetic retinopathy on stroke and severe bleeding riskin diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation: the loire valley atrialfibrillation project. ," BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is recognized as a stroke risk factor in atrialfibrillation (AF). Patients with diabetes with retinopathy have an increased riskfor systemic cardiovascular complications, and severe diabetic retinopathypredisposes to ocular bleeding. We hypothesized that patients with diabetes,retinopathy, and AF have increased stroke/thromboembolism (TE) and severebleeding risks when compared with patients with diabetes and AF who do not haveretinopathy or to patients with AF and without diabetes. METHODS: We tested ourhypothesis in a large ""real-world"" cohort of individuals with AF from the LoireValley Atrial Fibrillation project. RESULTS: Of 8,962 patients with AF in ourdataset, 1,409 (16%) had documented diabetes mellitus. Of these, 163 (1.8% of thewhole cohort) were patients with diabetic retinopathy. After a follow-up of 31+/- 36 months, when compared with patients without diabetes, the risk ofstroke/TE in patients with diabetes with no retinopathy increased 1.3-fold(relative risk [RR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.59; P = .01); in patients with diabeteswith retinopathy, the risk of stroke/TE was increased 1.58-fold (RR, 1.58; 95%CI, 1.07-2.32; P = .02). There was no significant difference when patients withdiabetes with no retinopathy were compared with patients with diabetes withretinopathy (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.80-1.84; P = .37). A similar pattern was seenfor mortality and severe bleeding. On multivariate analysis, the presence ofdiabetic retinopathy did not emerge as an independent predictor for stroke/TE orsevere bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Crude rates of stroke/TE increased in a stepwisefashion when patients without diabetes and with AF were compared with patientswith diabetes with no retinopathy and patients with diabetes with retinopathy.However, we have shown for the first time, to our knowledge, that the presence ofdiabetic retinopathy did not emerge as an independent predictor for stroke/TE orsevere bleeding on multivariate analysis.

 Diabetes and atrial fibrillation: stratification and prevention of stroke risks. ," BACKGROUND: Although evidence is not very clear, diabetes is assumed to be anindependent risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). One reason for the lack ofevidence could be that AF often is not detected due to its paroxysmal orasymptomatic character. A better understanding of the relationship between bothdiseases and improved detection of AF is necessary since the combination of bothdiseases dramatically increase the risk of strokes if not treated properly.METHODS: Available literature about diabetes as an independent risk factor for AFhas been evaluated, and limitations of studies are discussed. RESULTS: Resultsfrom different trials and registers are contradictory concerning diabetes as anindependent risk factor for AF. Reasons for these differences can be found indifferent study designs and neglecting patients with unknown AF. CONCLUSIONS: Dueto the increasing burden of disease of diabetes and AF as common risk factors forstroke, a systematic screening for AF in diabetes patients could provide a betterunderstanding of their correlation and personalized prevention strategies.

 Glucose fluctuations increase the incidence of atrial fibrillation in diabeticrats. ," AIMS: We investigated whether glucose fluctuations aggravate cardiac fibrosis andincrease the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in rats with diabetesmellitus (DM). METHODS AND RESULTS: Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats wererandomly divided into three groups: uncontrolled DM (U-STZ) group, controlled DM(C-STZ) group, and DM with glucose fluctuations (STZ-GF) group. Glucosefluctuations were induced by fasting for 24 h and additional regular insulininjections (0.5 IU/kg) administered three times per week for three consecutiveweeks. C-STZ rats were administered long acting insulin (20 IU/kg) twice a day tocontrol blood glucose levels. Cardiac fibrosis evaluated by Masson trichromestaining and the expressions of collagen type 1, collagen type 3, andalpha-smooth muscle actin were increased in U-STZ rats compared with C-STZ rats,which were more pronounced in STZ-GF rats. The inducibility of AF wassignificantly larger in U-STZ rats than C-STZ rats and was greatest in STZ-GFrats. To explore the mechanism of cardiac fibrosis, we investigated the levels ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. The expression of malondialdehyde,an indicator of ROS levels, was significantly upregulated in STZ-GF rats comparedwith U-STZ rats, along with increased thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip)expression in STZ-GF rats. Furthermore, caspase-3 expression and the number ofTUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased in STZ-GF rats compared withU-STZ and C-STZ rats. CONCLUSION: Glucose fluctuations increase the incidence ofAF by promoting cardiac fibrosis. Increased ROS levels caused by upregulation ofTxnip expression may be a mechanism whereby in glucose fluctuations inducefibrosis. ",no,new
 Rosiglitazone attenuates atrial structural remodeling and atrial fibrillationpromotion in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. ," INTRODUCTION: The pleiotropic effects of glitazones may favorably affect atrialremodeling. We sought to investigate the effects of peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) activator rosiglitazone onatrial structural remodeling and atrial fibrillation (AF) promotion inalloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. METHODS: Twenty alloxan-induced diabeticrabbits were randomly divided into two groups (10 animals in each group), namelythe diabetic rosiglitazone group (treated with rosiglitazone 2 mg/day/kg for 4weeks) and the nontreated diabetic group, while 10 additional healthy rabbitsserved as controls. Moreover, isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts wereused to evaluate atrial electrophysiological parameters and vulnerability to AF,examined by burst pacing. Histological examination was also performed, whereasplasma oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers were measured. RESULTS: Theduration of induced AF was significantly prolonged in the alloxan-induceddiabetic rabbits compared with controls (1.6 +/- 0.4 s vs. 0 s; P < 0.05).Rosiglitazone treatment significantly reduced the duration of induced AF in thetreated rabbits (1.6 +/- 0.4 s vs. 1.2 +/- 0.05 s; P < 0.05). Moreover,rosiglitazone attenuated atrial structural remodeling reducing the interatrialactivation time (35.4 +/- 12.1 ms vs. 24.2 +/- 10.8 ms, P < 0.05; control 23.3+/- 10.4 ms) and the atrial interstitial fibrosis as well (collagen volumefraction: 5.6 +/- 3.9% vs. 2.4 +/- 2.1%, P < 0.05; control 1.6 +/- 0.8%).Rosiglitazone increased plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and, on theother hand, decreased malondialdehyde (MDA), hs-C-reactive protein, and tumornecrosis factor-alpha levels. CONCLUSION: Rosiglitazone attenuates arrhythmogenicatrial structural remodeling and AF promotion in alloxan-induced diabeticrabbits. Also, it seems to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation in thisexperimental model. ",no,new
 Diabetes mellitus--risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Potential therapeuticimplications. ," The relationship between atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus type 2 iscontroversial, and various studies have demonstrated conflicting results.However, the majority of larger prospective studies published during recent yearsdemonstrated a positive correlation. After multivariate adjustment diabetesincreased the risk for atrial fibrillation at least two fold. This combination isassociated with substantially increased risks of death and cardiovascular events(stroke and heart failure). Atrial fibrillation in patients with diabetesmellitus type 2 identifies individuals who are likely to obtain greater benefitsfrom glycemic control and anticoagulants as well as antihypertensive therapy.

 Can preoperative serum level of creatinine predict new-onset atrial fibrillationin non-diabetic male patients undergoing open heart surgery? A retrograde view. ," Renal dysfunction is a risk marker in patients who candidate for coronary arterybypass graft (CABG). Renal disorder is associated with prolonged stays inintensive care unit and hospital, morbidity and mortality. Aim of this study isspecific evaluation of association between preoperative creatinine (Cr) withatrial fibrillation (AF) after elective off-pump CABG in non-diabetic malepatients with normal ejection fraction. Two hundred non-diabetic male patientswith normal ejection fraction undergoing elective off pump CABG surgery enrolledin this cross-sectional study and were stratified by present or absence ofpostoperative atrial fibrillation: patients with postoperative new-onset atrialfibrillation (n=100) as group 1 and patients without new-onset postoperativeatrial fibrillation as group 2 (n=100). Preoperative serological test of theparticipants, such as serum creatinine, were recorded in their medical dossiers.Data were analyzed in SPSS-16 software and tested for association between atrialfibrillation with creatinine level by using student t test, chi-square test orlogistic regression. Cr level in patients with and without AF three days beforesurgery were 1.8+/-0.3 and 1.0+/-0.4 respectively (P value for Cr=0.00). Onsurgical day, mean Cr level in patients with and without AF were 1.6+/-0.2 and1.1+/-0.5 respectively (P value for Cr = 0.00). Of the 100, male patients withpostoperative AF, duration and frequency of recurrence of AF were not associatedwith Cr at three days before surgery and on surgical days (P>0.05).

" Diabetes, Obesity and Atrial Fibrillation: Epidemiology, Mechanisms andInterventions.

Over the last few decades, wehave witnessed a global rise in adult obesity of epidemic proportions. Similarly,there has been a parallel increase in the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF),itself a significant cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This may bepartly attributable to advances in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD)and heart failure (HF) improving life expectancy, however, epidemiologicalstudies have demonstrated an independent association between obesity, diabetesand AF, suggesting possible common pathophysiological mechanisms and riskfactors. Indeed, cardiac remodeling, haemodynamic alterations, autonomicdysfunction, and diastolic dysfunction have been reported in obese and diabeticcohorts. Moreover, diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by an adversestructural and functional cardiac phenotype, which may predispose to thedevelopment of AF. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological andmechanistic relationships between obesity, diabetes and AF, and some of thechallenges posed in the management of this high-risk group of individuals.

METHODS:A total of 464 type 2 diabetic patients younger than 60 years were included in alongitudinal observational study and matched to patients without diabetes.Patients underwent 48-h electrocardiographic Holter monitoring quarterly todetect brief subclinical episodes of AF (duration of AF <48 h) and were followedup for 37 months. The outcomes were SCI, assessed by magnetic resonance imagingof the brain, and stroke events during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Theprevalence of subclinical episodes of AF was significantly greater among patientswith diabetes compared with matched healthy subjects (11% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.0001).During an average duration of 37 months, 43 stroke events occurred in thediabetic population and no events occurred in healthy subjects. Diabetic patientswith silent episodes of AF (n = 176) had a higher baseline prevalence of SCI (61%vs. 29%; p < 0.01) and a higher number of stroke events (17.3% vs. 5.9%; p <0.01) during the follow-up period than the other patients (n = 288). An episodeof silent AF was an independent determinant of SCI (odds ratio: 4.441; p < 0.001;confidence interval: 2.42 to 8.16) and an independent predictor of the occurrenceof stroke in diabetic patients (hazard ratio: 4.6; p < 0.01; confidence interval:2.7 to 9.1).

 Mechanism of and therapeutic strategy for atrial fibrillation associated withdiabetes mellitus. ," Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most important risk factors for atrialfibrillation (AF) and is a predictor of stroke and thromboembolism. DM mayincrease the incidence of AF, and when it is combined with other risk factors,the incidence of stroke and thromboembolism may also be higher; furthermore,hospitalization due to heart failure appears to increase. Maintenance ofwell-controlled blood glucose and low levels of HbA1c in accordance withguidelines may decrease the incidence of AF. The mechanisms of AF associated withDM are autonomic remodeling, electrical remodeling, structural remodeling, andinsulin resistance. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is suggested to bean upstream therapy for this type of AF. Studies have indicated that catheterablation may be effective for AF associated with DM, restoring sinus rhythm andimproving prognosis. Catheter ablation combined with hypoglycemic agents mayfurther increase the rate of maintenance of sinus rhythm and reduce the need forreablation. ",no,new
 Impaired atrial electromechanical function and atrial fibrillation promotion inalloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. ," BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor for atrialfibrillation (AF). However, the underlying mechanisms are still not clearlyelucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the atrial electromechanicalfunction, atrial electrophysiological changes and AF inducibility inalloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. METHODS: In 8 alloxan-induced diabetic rabbitsand 8 controls, we evaluated atrial electromechanical function by tissue Dopplerimaging. Isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were prepared to measureatrial refractory effective period (AERP) and its dispersion (AERPD), interatrialconduction time (IACT) and vulnerability to AF.

 Supplemental magnesium for prevention of atrial fibrillation: role of diabetesmellitus. ,"I read with interest the article by Dr De Oliveira et al.1 They chose 20 studies with defined criteria and divided them into “lower” and “higher” quality based on Jadad scores>3 and?3, respectively. The authors concluded that systemic magnesium sulfate did not decrease the incidence of postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias in the higher-quality studies (Jadad scores>3) and the reported effect was attributable to the lower-quality studies (Jadad scores?3). Because a study conducted by my colleagues and me is included in the list of clinical trials with higher quality,2 it shows that we did not detect any effect for magnesium in lowering the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). Although the primary results of our research are in accord with the findings of this meta-analysis, there are some points to be clarified.

The incidence of AF in our patients who received supplemental magnesium was lower than in the control group (7.2% v 12.3%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.12). After categorizing the patients as diabetics and nondiabetics, we detected a significant difference between the magnesium-supplemented and control groups for nondiabetic patients (Table 1).

METHODS: SixtyJapanese rabbits were randomly assigned to alloxan-induced diabetic group (n=30)and control group (n=30). Ten rabbits in each group were respectively used toelectrophysiological and histological study, patch-clamp study and Westernblotting analysis. Langendorff perfusion was used to record inter-atrialconduction time (IACT), atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and dispersion(AERPD) and vulnerability to AF. Histological study was measured by Sirius-redstain. Patch-clamp technique was used to measure action potential duration (APD)and atrial ionic currents (INa and ICaL). Western blotting was applied to assessatrial protein expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1).RESULTS: Compared with control group, electrophysiological studies showed IACTwas prolonged (37.91+/-6.81 vs. 27.43+/-1.63ms, p<0.01), AERPD was increased(30.37+/-8.33 vs. 14.70+/-5.16ms, p<0.01) in diabetic group. Inducibility of AFin diabetic group was significantly higher than in controls (8/10 vs. 1/10 ofanimals, p<0.01). Collagen volume fraction was increased (6.20+/-0.64% vs.2.15+/-0.21%, p<0.01) in diabetic group.

"," INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia.Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) is a frequent complication of diabetesmellitus and has a negative impact on the cardiovascular system. There are nodata about the occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in thepopulation with DAN. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed the data of 100 patientswith PAF. The study population was divided into three groups: group I: 28patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and DAN, group II: 34 patients with DMwithout DAN, and group III: 38 patients without DM. P-wave duration (FPD) anddispersion (PWD) were measured during sinus rhythm and AF episodes were countedduring 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Recurrence of PAF was higher in group I(47 episodes/year) compared to groups II and III (26 and 22 episodes/year) -p<0.01. The FPD was longer in group I (137.4 +/-12.0 ms vs. 126 +/-23.0 ms in IIgroup and 129 +/-18.3 ms in group III; p<0.001). The PWD was longer in patientswith DAN (53 +/-19 ms vs. 36 +/-18 ms and 34 +/- 20 ms, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:The results showed that the presence of DAN caused a significant increase inP-wave duration and dispersion, which might be responsible for the recurrence ofAF. ",no,new
Atrial fibrillation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: specific featuresof development and antirecurrence therapy. ," We examined 212 patients aged 52-70 years with persistent symptomatic atrialfibrillation (AF). Comparison of AF substrates in patients with (n=26) andwithout (n=27) type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) revealed slowing of intraatrialconduction, increased vulnerability of atria, and more pronounced worsening ofleft ventricular diastolic function among DM2 patients. Comparison of groups ofpatients with (n=32) and without (n=33) diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy(CAN) revealed augmentation of adrenergic influences on the heart andcomparatively higher antirecurrence efficacy of sotalol among patients with CAN.In 94 patients with type 2 DM complicated with CAN after randomization weadministered antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol in combination with perindopril(n=33), lipoic acid (n=31), perindopril and lipoic acid (n=30), and comparedresults with sotalol monotherapy. In 6 months percentage of patients in sinusrhythm was significantly higher in the group of combination therapy (sotalol plusperindopril plus lipoic acid). This was probably a result of simultaneouscorrection of disturbances caused by both ""diabetic cardiomyopathy"" and CAN. ",no,new
" Diabetes mellitus, glycemic control, and risk of atrial fibrillation. "," BACKGROUND: Diabetes may be an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation.However, results from prior studies are in conflict, and no study has examineddiabetes duration or glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association ofdiabetes with risk of atrial fibrillation and to describe risk according todiabetes duration and glycemic control. DESIGN: A population-based case-controlstudy. PARTICIPANTS: Within a large, integrated healthcare delivery system, weidentified 1,410 people with newly-recognized atrial fibrillation from ICD-9codes and validated cases by review of medical records. 2,203 controls withoutatrial fibrillation were selected from enrollment lists, stratified on age, sex,hypertension, and calendar year. MAIN MEASURES: Information on atrialfibrillation, diabetes and other characteristics came from medical records.Diabetes was defined based on physician diagnoses recorded in the medical record,and pharmacologically treated diabetes was defined as receiving antihyperglycemicmedications. Information about hemoglobin A1c levels came from computerizedlaboratory data. KEY RESULTS: Among people with atrial fibrillation, 252/1410(17.9%) had pharmacologically treated diabetes compared to 311/2203 (14.1%) ofcontrols. The adjusted OR for atrial fibrillation was 1.40 (95% CI 1.15-1.71) forpeople with treated diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Among those withtreated diabetes, the risk of developing atrial fibrillation was 3% higher foreach additional year of diabetes duration (95% CI 1-6%). Compared to peoplewithout diabetes, the adjusted OR for people with treated diabetes with averagehemoglobin A1c <or=7 was 1.06 (95% CI 0.74-1.51); for A1c >7 but <or=8, 1.48(1.09-2.01); for A1c >8 but <or=9, 1.46 (1.02-2.08); and for A1c >9, 1.96(1.22-3.14). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was associated with higher risk of developingatrial fibrillation, and risk was higher with longer duration of treated diabetesand worse glycemic control. Future research should identify and test approachesto reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation in people with diabetes. ",yes,new
 Influences of autonomic nervous system on atrial arrhythmogenic substrates andthe incidence of atrial fibrillation in diabetic heart. ," Diabetes mellitus (DM) is clinically associated with an increased incidence ofatrial fibrillation (AF), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Wehypothesized that neural remodeling enhances AF vulnerability in diabetic hearts.Eight weeks after creating streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (DM rats) orcontrol rats, the hearts were perfused according to the Langendorff method.Inducibility of AF was evaluated by 5 times burst pacing from the right atriumand the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was measured. The protocol wasrepeated during sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) or parasympathetic nervestimulation (PNS). In tissue samples taken from the right atrium, the density ofnerves positive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)were determined. SNS significantly increased the incidence of AF in DM rats (14+/- 6 to 30 +/- 8%, P < 0.01), but not in control rats (11 +/- 4 to 14 +/- 6%,NS). Although AERP was significantly decreased by SNS in both rats (each P <0.01), increased heterogeneity of AERP by SNS was seen only in DM rats. PNSsignificantly decreased AERP and increased the incidence of AF (9 +/- 5 to 30 +/-5% in control rats, 12 +/- 6 to 27 +/- 6% in DM rats, each P < 0.01) in bothrats. The density of TH-positive nerves was heterogeneous in DM rats comparedwith control rats, whereas the heterogeneity of AChE-positive nerves was notdifferent in the rats. The prevalence of AF was enhanced by adrenergic activationin diabetic hearts, in which heterogeneous sympathetic innervation was evident.These results suggest that neural remodeling may play a crucial role forincreased AF vulnerability in DM.

 Obstructive coronary artery disease in high-risk diabetic patients with andwithout atrial fibrillation. ," OBJECTIVE: To investigate the severity of coronary artery disease by coronaryangiography in age-matched and sex-matched patients with diabetes mellitus withatrial fibrillation versus sinus rhythm. METHODS: The patients included 245 menand women, mean age of 70 years, with diabetes and atrial fibrillation and 245age-matched and sex-matched patients with diabetes and sinus rhythm who underwentcoronary angiography. Baseline characteristics and indications for coronaryangiography were similar in both groups. RESULTS: Greater than 50% narrowing ofone, two, or three major coronary arteries were present in 229 of 245 patients(94%) with diabetes and atrial fibrillation and in 211 of 245 patients (86%) withdiabetes and with sinus rhythm (P<0.01). Greater than 50% narrowing of threemajor coronary arteries were present in 150 of 245 patients (61%) with diabetesand atrial fibrillation and in 75 of 245 patients (31%) with diabetes and sinusrhythm (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with diabetes and atrial fibrillation havea significantly higher prevalence of greater than 50% narrowing of one or moremajor coronary arteries and of three major coronary arteries than patients withdiabetes and sinus rhythm.

 [Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and antiplatelet in diabetes mellitustype 2. How do we do it?]. ," BACKGROUND: In spite of evidence about the interest of anticoagulation in AtrialFibrillation (AF) and antiplatelet to diabetics (DM) type 2, the national andinternational references describe a low level of assumption of those criteria inpractice. Published studies on these aspects are unavailable in Navarre. METHODS:Cross-sectional study. POPULATION: primary care patients (1,600 people > 15years). INCLUSION CRITERIA: patients diagnosed of AF / with diagnosis of DM type2, over 40. VARIABLES: age and sex, criteria of AF with high embolic risk (>6%annual) and cardiovascular risk factors in DM2. DATA COLLECTION: in computerisedregisters of Organisation and Management Information. ANALYSIS: (populationuniverse studied), results in absolute numbers and percentages. RESULTS:Twenty-five people with diagnosis of chronic FA (14 women and 11 men, average age78.36 years); 22 (81.8%) show high embolic risk. There were counter-indicationsin 4 cases. Type 2 diabetics totalled 69 people (29 women and 40 men, average age68.57 years). There are 16 (23.1%) in primary prevention (PP), 26 (37.3%) insecondary prevention (SP), and 27 (39.1%) do not follow antiplatelet therapy.There is counter-indication in 8 cases and 14 patients (20.2%) would besusceptible to intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The results of oral anticoagulanttherapy (OAT) in high risk AF exceed the reviewed references. The PP with DM2 aresimilar figures to other studies; a area of improvement was detected. We must askfor the opinion of the patient and individualise these therapies. The familydoctor has a significant responsibility in cardiovascular prevention of thepatients affected by these problems.

 The prothrombotic risk of diabetes mellitus in atrial fibrillation and heartfailure. ,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) [1] and diabetes mellitus (DM) [2] are predisposing factors to the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). All three conditions are associated with thrombosis-related complications, such as stroke and thromboembolism. Endothelial damage/dysfunction and platelet abnormalities, which are manifest in AF, DM and CHF [2–10], may underline the etiology of a prothrombotic state in these conditions, individually and in combination. Of note, endothelial abnormalities in DM have been demonstrated to be only partially influenced by contemporary intensified multi-factorial cardiovascular risk intervention, suggesting the need for earlier and more aggressive risk factor intervention [11]. Our aim was to further examine the contribution of DM to the prothrombotic risk in AF and CHF, and hypothesized that the presence of DM augments endothelial damage/dysfunction and increases the platelet activation in patients with AF with and without CHF.

We tested this hypothesis by performing a cross-sectional study of patients with AF, with and without DM and CHF, as a substudy of subjects (except for those from the adjusted dose/therapeutic dose warfarin arm) participating in the 3rd Stroke Prevention in AF study (SPAF-III) [Table 1a]. Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF, a marker of endothelial damage/dysfunction [12]) and soluble P-selectin (sP-sel, a marker of platelet activation [13]) were measured using ELISA. Variance in the distribution of VWF, sP-sel, blood pressure, age and body mass index (BMI) across groups was analyzed using one-way anova (or Kruskal–Wallis test, for non-parametric data). Inter-group differences were analyzed using Tukey post hoc analysis (or Mann–Whitney test, for non-parametric data). A ?2 test was used for similar analyses among categorical cardiovascular risk variables. Logistic multivariate analysis was used to assess the association of DM with measured variables, and estimated odds ratios were calculated for significant independent associations.",no,new
 Diabetic atrial fibrillation patients: mortality and risk for stroke or embolismduring a 10-year follow-up. ," BACKGROUND: To compare in atrial fibrillation patients with and without diabetes,(1) baseline characteristics, (2) additional risk factors for stroke orperipheric or visceral embolism (hypertension, previous stroke, age >75 years),(3) mortality, (4) stroke or embolism, and (5) oral anticoagulation in the year2000. METHODS: Included were 409 outpatients with nonrheumatic atrialfibrillation (62 +/- 12 years, 36% female). All underwent transthoracic andtransesophageal echocardiography. Patients with thrombi received oralanticoagulation; patients without thrombi received aspirin until the follow-up in1995; afterwards, oral anticoagulation according to risk factors for stroke orembolism was recommended. Patients were contacted during the year 2000. RESULTS:Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 73 patients (18%). Sixteen (22%) diabetic and169 (50%) nondiabetic patients had no other risk factors for stroke or embolism(p < 0.0001). Diabetic patients were older, had more frequent heart failure,hypertension, myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, valvularabnormalities, left atrial or appendage thrombi, larger left atria, and leftatrial appendages than nondiabetic patients. Mean follow-up was 115 months.Diabetic patients had a higher mortality than nondiabetic patients (7%/yearversus 4%/year, p < 0.0001). The rate of stroke or embolism of diabetic (3%/year)and nondiabetic patients (2%/year) was similar. The rate of oral anticoagulationwas higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients (p = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS:Diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation frequently have additional riskfactors for stroke or embolism, and thus should be treated with oralanticoagulation. Whether in the rare cases of atrial fibrillation, in whomdiabetes is the only clinical risk factor, oral anticoagulation is indicatedcannot be answered by the present study. ",yes,new
 Effect of diabetes mellitus in recovery and maintenance of sinus rhythm inpatients with persistent atrial fibrillation. ," INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is frequently accompanied by cardiac rhythmdisorders. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiacarrhythmia in adult population [1, 2]. According to some of the largeepidemiological studies diabetes mellitus is among independent risk factors fordevelopment and persistence of atrial fibrillation [3]. Both diabetes mellitusand atrial fibrillation independently increase the risk of thromboembolism,especially of stroke [3-5]. It is obvious that rhythm control, i.e. restorationand maintenance of sinus rhythm, may be essential for prevention ofthromboembolism in these patients. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study isto analyse the impact of diabetes mellitus on rhythm control in patients withpersistent atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We analysed the impact of diabetesmellitus and other clinical and echocardiographic parameters (age, gender,current arrhythmia duration, presence of previous episodes of persistent atrialfibrillation, cardiac and/or noncardiac diseases, left atrial diameter and leftventricular ejection fraction) on outcome of attempted cardioversion in patientswith persistent atrial fibrillation admitted to Cardiologic Department of theInstitute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, between January1992 and December 1999. We also analysed retrospectively the impact of diabetesmellitus and other parameters listed above on the presence of previous episodesof atrial fibrillation in our patients, that at our opinion reflected thepossibilities of sinus rhythm maintenance in these patients. All continuousparameters were expressed as mean value and standard deviation. Statisticalsignificance of differences between variables was examined using Chi-square test.For identification of independent predictors of examined outcomes we usedmultiple logistic regression model with 95% of confidence interval. Statisticalanalysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)programme. RESULTS: Of 378 patients with currently persistent atrialfibrillation, aged mean 53.98 +/- 11.69 years, there were 266 (70.4%) men.Diabetes mellitus was previously diagnosed in 27 (7.1%) patients, cardiacdiseases in 223 (59.0%), noncardiac diseases in 47 (12.4%) and 140 (37.0%)patients had ""lone"" atrial fibrillation. Left atrial enlargement was noted in 224(59.3%) patients, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in 82 (21.7%).Atrial fibrillation lasted 48 hours to 9 years, mean 8.5 +/- 18.14 months beforecardioversion. While 43 patients had previous episodes of persistent AF for last1-30 years, mean 10.5 +/- 7.3,335 patients never experienced AF before. There wasa statistically significant difference in percent of diabetic patients (18.6%/43vs. 5.7%/335, value of Chi-square test = 7.759, p < 0.01) in these two groups. Weanalysed the impact of diabetes mellitus on outcome of attempted cardioversionand on presence of previous episodes of AF reflecting the success in maintainingsinus rhythm. Multiple logistic regression models for all of 378 patients, withdependent variable being present in previous recurrent atrial fibrillations andindependent variables of clinical and echocardiographic parameters as listed,identified diabetes mellitus to be an independent predictor of repeated atrialfibrillations with relative risk of 4.6 (CI 95%). When dependent variable in thesame model was outcome of cardioversion (sinus rhythm is restored in 281/378patients--74%) diabetes mellitus was not among independent predictors ofsuccessful cardioversion. DISCUSSION: The relationship between atrialfibrillation and diabetes mellitus is not completely understood, including theimpact of known complications of diabetes mellitus on electrophysiologicalproperties of atrial myocardium and development of atrial fibrillation [6].Besides being the independent risk factor for occurrence of atrial fibrillation,diabetes mellitus, according to our results, appears to influence thepossibilities of maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of permanent atrialfibrillation in diabetic patients. We found that patients with diabetes mellitusand persistent atrial fibrillation may be successfully converted to sinus rhythmlike any other group of patients, but the presence of diabetes mellitus increasesthe risk of arrhythmia recurrence for 4.6 times compared to patients withoutdiabetes mellitus. Obviously, diabetic patients need to be treated with moreefficacious antiarrhythmics from the very beginning, including amiodarone, whichsuccessfully prevents recurrent atrial fibrillation in the majority of patients[7, 8]. CONCLUSION: We concluded that diabetes mellitus independently predictsthe presence of recurrent atrial fibrillation but does not influence thepossibility of sinus rhythm restoration. The relationship between atrialfibrillation and diabetes mellitus needs further investigation. ",no,new
" The effects of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, transientischemic attack and smoking on stroke in Chinese people.

 Mitral annular calcification progression and the risk of atrial fibrillation:results from MESA. ," Aims: To determine if progression of mitral annular calcium (MAC) detected bycardiac computed tomography (CT) predicts incident atrial fibrillation (AF).Methods and results: This analysis included 5683 participants (mean age 64 +/- 10years; 52% women; 40% whites; 27% blacks; 21% Hispanics; 12% Chinese-Americans)from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. MAC was measured by cardiac CT atbaseline and at a follow-up CT scan over a mean time of 2.4 +/- 0.84 years. AFwas ascertained by review of hospital discharge records and from Medicare claimsdata through 31 December 2012. Cox regression was used to compute hazard ratios(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between MACprogression and AF. Over a median follow-up of 8.6 years, a total of 533 (9.4%)incident AF cases were detected. In a model adjusted for age, sex,race/ethnicity, education, income, baseline MAC, systolic blood pressure, bodymass index, diabetes, smoking, total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteincholesterol, antihypertensive medications, lipid-lowering therapies, and aspirin,any MAC progression (>0/year) was associated with an increased risk for AF (HR =1.50, 95% CI = 1.20-1.87). Multiplicative interactions were not significantbetween MAC progression and AF by age (<65 year vs. older), sex, orrace/ethnicity (whites vs. non-whites). Conclusion: Important prognosticinformation regarding AF risk is obtained with follow-up MAC measurement, as therisk for participants with any MAC progression was substantively greater thanparticipants without progression. MAC progression may detect underlying leftatrial abnormalities that predispose to AF. ",yes,new
" Temporal Trends in Incidence, Prevalence, and Mortality of Atrial Fibrillation inPrimary Care. "," BACKGROUND: Incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) are expected toincrease dramatically; however, we currently lack comprehensive data on temporaltrends in unselected clinical populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of theUK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1998 to 2010 of patients withincident AF, excluding major valvular disease, linked to hospital admission dataand national statistics. Fifty-seven thousand eight hundred eighteen adults wereidentified with mean age 74.2 (SD, 11.7) years and 48.3% women. Overallage-adjusted incidence of AF per 1000 person years was 1.11 (95% CI, 1.09-1.13)in 1998-2001, 1.33 (1.31-1.34) in 2002-2006, and 1.33 (1.31-1.35) in 2007-2010.Ongoing increases in incidence were noted for patients aged >/=75 years, withsimilar temporal patterns in women and men. Associated comorbidities varied overtime, with a constant prevalence of previous stroke, increases in hypertensionand diabetes mellitus, and decreases in ischemic heart disease. Among patientsaged 55 to 74 years, there was a significant reduction in mortality over time(P<0.001), but mortality rates in patients aged >/=75 years remained static at14% to 15% per year (P=0.84). Projections of AF prevalence demonstrated aconstant yearly rise, increasing from 700 000 patients in 2010 to between 1.3 and1.8 million patients with AF in the United Kingdom by 2060. CONCLUSIONS: In alarge general practice population, incident AF increased and then plateauedoverall, with a continued increase in patients aged >/=75 years. The largeprojected increase in AF prevalence associated with temporal changes inAF-related comorbidities suggests the need for comprehensive implementation of AFprevention and management strategies.

 Incidence and Risk Factors for Atrial Fibrillation in Korea: the National HealthInsurance Service Database (2002-2010). ," BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia thatis known as an important independent risk factor for stroke. However, limitedinformation is available on AF in Korea. This study evaluated the incidence ofAF, its associated co-morbidities and risk factors for AF in Korea. SUBJECTS ANDMETHODS: The National Health Insurance Service database between 2002 and 2010 wasused in the study. Individuals<30 years old and those diagnosed with AF between2002 and 2004 were excluded. Hazard ratios (HRs) according to co-morbidities andrisk factors for AF were determined using a Cox proportional hazard model.Population attributable fractions (PAFs) of AF risk factors were determined.RESULTS: During a 6-year follow-up period, 3517 (1.7%) developed AF. Theincidence rates in men and women aged 30-39 years were 0.82 and 0.55 per 1000person-years, respectively; the incidence rates further increased with age to13.09 and 11.54 per 1000 person-years in men and women aged>/=80 years,respectively. The risk factors for incident AF were age, sex, body mass index(BMI), hypertension, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and heart failure. Afteradjusting for variables related to AF, the risk of AF was significantlyassociated with hypertension (HR 1.667), IHD (HR 1.639), heart failure (HR1.521), and the PAFs for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, IHD, heart failure anddiabetes mellitus were 30.6%, 10.1%, 3.4%, 16.6%, 8.2%, 5.3% and 0.8%,respectively. CONCLUSION: Incidence of AF increased with age and was higher inmen than in women. A larger proportion of AF events was attributable tohypertension than to other co-morbidities. ",yes,new
 Risk factors for atrial fibrillation in type 2 diabetes: report from the SwedishNational Diabetes Register (NDR). ," AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is more frequent in patients withdiabetes than in the general population. However, characteristics contributing toAF risk in diabetes remain speculative. METHODS: Observational study of 83,162patients with type 2 diabetes, aged 30-79 years, with no baseline AF, 17% hadhistory of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 3.3% history of congestive heartfailure (CHF), followed up for development of AF during mean 6.8 years from2005-2007 to 2012. A subgroup of 67,780 patients without history of CVD or CHFwas also analysed. RESULTS: Using Cox regression, cardiovascular risk factorsassociated with risk for AF were updated mean BMI (HR 1.31 per 5 kg/m(2)) orobesity (HR 1.51), updated mean systolic BP (SBP; HR 1.13 per 10 mmHg) orhypertension (HR 1.71), and cumulative microalbuminuria (HR 1.21), p < 0.001 forall analyses. Male sex, increasing age and height were also significantpredictors. HRs were 1.76 for a history of CHF and 2.56 for in-study CHF, while1.32 for history of CVD and 1.38 for in-study CHD (p < 0.001). Among patientswithout history of CVD or CHF, significant predictors were similarly BMI, SBP,and cumulative microalbuminuria and CHF. The risk of AF differed in the subgroupsachieving or not achieving a target BP < 140/85 mmHg. The HRs for AF were (per 10mmHg increase) 0.88 and 1.24, respectively.

 Impact of intensive glycemic control on the incidence of atrial fibrillation andassociated cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study). ," Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(DM) and is associated with markers of poor glycemic control; however, the impactof glycemic control on incident AF and outcomes is unknown. The aims of thisstudy were to prospectively evaluate if intensive glycemic control in patientswith DM affects incident AF and to evaluate morbidity and mortality in patientswith DM and incident AF. A total of 10,082 patients with DM from the Action toControl Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) cohort were studied in arandomized, double-blind fashion. Participants were randomized to an intensivetherapeutic strategy targeting a glycated hemoglobin level of <6.0% or a standardstrategy targeting a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0% to 7.9%. Incident AFoccurred in 159 patients (1.58%) over the follow-up period, at a rate of 5.9 per1,000 patient-years in the intensive-therapy group and a rate of 6.37 per 1,000patient-years in the standard-therapy group (p = 0.52). In a multivariate model,predictors of incident AF were age, weight, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,and heart failure history. Patients with DM and new-onset AF had a hazard ratioof 2.65 for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 3.86, p <0.0001),a hazard ratio of 2.1 for myocardial infarction (95% confidence interval 1.33 to3.31, p = 0.0015), and a hazard ratio of 3.80 for the development of heartfailure (95% confidence interval 2.48 to 5.84, p <0.0001).

The study population was composedof 98,961 men and 55,109 women over 30 years of age who had a free medicalcheckup at the IPC Center (Centre d'Investigations Preventives et Cliniques).Routine electrocardiograms revealed the presence of AF in 235 men (mean age 60.2+/- 10.3 years) and 63 women (mean age 62.5 +/- 9.1 years). Mean follow-up was15.2 years. The relative risk of death [Hazard Ratio (95% CI)] was determinedwith a Cox regression model. The prevalence of AF increased strongly with age inboth genders and was higher among men. Before 50 years of age, AF was present in0.05% of men and 0.01% of women, compared to 6.5% and 5.2%, respectively, inover-80s. After adjustment for age, factors significantly associated with AF werecardiopathy [Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.2 (2.3-4.5) among men and 4.9 (2.5-9.5) amongwomen], hypertension [OR = 1.4 (1.1-1.9) in men and 2.2 (1.2-3.9) in women],overweight [OR = 2.2 (1.4-3.2) in men and 2.3 (1.0-5. 1) in women], ventilatoryfailure [OR = 1.4 (0.9-2.2) in men and 4.9 (2.4-10) in women], diabetes [OR = 1.7(1.1-2.5) in men] and alcohol consumption [OR = 1.7 (1.2-2.4) in men].

The HR of all-cause mortality was 1.5 (1.0-2.0) inmen and 1.8 (1.0-3.3) in women. The HR of cardiovascular mortality was 2.2(1.2-3.1) in men and 3.4 (1.5-7. 7) in women, while for stroke-related mortalityit was 2.0 (0.7-4.3) in men and 4.5 (1.3-16) in women. No association was foundbetween AF and non-cardiovascular mortality in either men or women. The risk ofdeath among men without cardiopathy or hypertension, after adjustment for theother risk factors, was not significantly increased (overall mortality 1.1(0.5-2.0), cardiovascular mortality 1.4 (0.6-2.9)). In contrast, men withcardiopathy or hypertension had an adjusted HR of 1.7 (1.1-2.8) for overallmortality and 2.6 (1.3-5.3) for cardiovascular mortality. In conclusion, afteradjustment for all risk factors, the AF-related relative risk of overallmortality and of cardiovascular mortality was higher among women than among men,especially for cerebrovascular mortality. AF was not an independent risk factorfor death among men free of cardiopathy and hypertension. ",yes,new
 [The etiology and associated risk factors in a sample of 300 patients with atrialfibrillation]. ," PURPOSE: To analyze the etiology and the prevalence of risk factors in patientswith atrial fibrillation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Applying an unpaired casecontrolled study, we examined 300 consecutive patients (143 men) with atrialfibrillation and a mean age of 66 +/- 8 years. This group is compared with acontrol group of 700 patients (mean age 64 +/- 12 years). RESULTS: In the groupwith atrial fibrillation the etiology in 32% was arterial hypertension, in 20%coronary heart disease, in 13% valvular heart disease, in 11% heart failure, in4% hyperthyroidism and in 20% idiopathic. 50% presented hypertension, 29%tobaccoism, 26% left ventricular hypertrophy, 20% consumption of alcohol, 19%hypercholesterolemia and 16% diabetes. Compared with the control group, patientswith atrial fibrillation had coronary heart disease (p < 0.05), VHD (p < 0.01),myocardiopathy (p < 0.05), HT (p < 0.001), left ventricular hypertrophy (p <0.001), diabetes (p < 0.01) and alcohol consumption (p < 0.01) more frequently.In the multivariant analysis heart failure (odds ratio 2.1 [1.2-3.3]), thevalvular heart disease (odds ratio 2.2 [1.4-3.5]), the coronary heart disease(odds ratio 1.8 [1.2-2.6]), the arterial hypertension (odds ratio 1.7 [1.2-2.3]),the left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio 2.6 [1.7-3.8]), the diabetes (oddsratio 1.9 [1.2-2.9]) and alcoholic habits (odds ratio 2 [1.3-3.9]) wereindependent risk factors for atrial fibrillation in our population. CONCLUSIONS:Atrial fibrillation in our study, is more frequent in patients with arterialhypertension, coronary heart disease or valvular heart disease. There are otherrisk factors such as arterial hypertension, diabetes and consumption of alcoholtoo, the modification of which could diminish the risk of the appearance ofatrial fibrillation. ",yes,new
" CHA2DS2-VASc Score (Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age >/=75 [Doubled],Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack [Doubled], VascularDisease, Age 65-74, Female) for Stroke in Asian Patients With AtrialFibrillation: A Korean Nationwide Sample Cohort Study. "," BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The CHA2DS2-VASc stroke score (congestive heart failure,hypertension, age >/=75 (doubled), diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transientischemic attack (doubled), vascular disease, age 65-74, female) is used in mostguidelines for risk stratification in atrial fibrillation (AF), but most data forthis score have been derived in Western populations. Ethnic differences in strokerisk may be present. Our objective was to investigate risk factors for stroke inAF and application of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in an Asian AF population fromKorea. METHODS: A total of 5855 oral anticoagulant-naive nonvalvular AF patientsaged >/=20 years were enrolled from Korea National Health Insurance ServiceSample cohort from 2002 to 2008 and were followed up until December 2013.RESULTS: The incidence rates (per 100 person-years) of ischemic stroke were 3.32in the total population, being 0.23 in low-risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score 0 [male] or 1[female]) and 4.59 in high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc >/=2). Incidence rates ofischemic stroke or the composite thromboembolism end point showed a clearincrease with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc score. On multivariable analysis,significant associations between CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors and ischemic strokewere observed; however, the significance of vascular disease or diabetes mellituswas attenuated after multivariate adjustment, and female sex (hazard ratio, 0.73;95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.84) had a lower risk of ischemic stroke thanmales. Patients who were categorized as low risk consistently had an event rate<1% per year. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of CHA2DS2-VASc score in Asians iscomparable with that in Western populations. The score shows good performance indefining the truly-low-risk AF patients for stroke/thromboembolism. ",yes,new
Analysis of clinical characteristics and risk of stroke and death within 1 yearof patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation combined with diabetesmellitus. ," OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics and impact of diabetesmellitus (DM) on prognosis in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF).METHODS: Data of nonvalvular AF patients in the Chinese Emergency AtrialFibrillation Registry Study were retrospectively analyzed. The eligible patientswere divided into the DM group and the non-DM group. Uni- and multi-variate Coxregression analysis were used to explore risk factors of 1-year outcomes.RESULTS: A total of 1 644 patients were enrolled in the study with 227 patientscombined with DM (16.8%). Compared with non-DM group, patients with DM were olderand had higher body weight, had higher prevalence of myocardial infarction,coronary heart disease, hypertension and stroke, and were at higher risk ofthromboembolism. The proportion of anticoagulant treatment was low in both groups(10.1% vs 7.4%, P=0.141). Compared with patients without DM, patients with DM hadhigher all-cause mortality (19.5% vs 12.7%, P=0.004), cardiovascular death (10.8%vs 7.02%, P=0.047) and combined end events (CEE, 26.4% vs 2.4%, P=0.023), whilewith comparable incidence of stroke (10.1% vs 7.4%, P=0.141). Multi-variate Coxregression analysis showed that DM was an independent risk factor for 1-yearall-cause mortality (HR=1.558, 95% CI 1.126-2.156), cardiovascular death(HR=1.615, 95% CI 1.052-2.479) and CEE (HR=1.523, 95% CI 1.098-2.112), while notfor stroke (HR=1.523, 95% CI 1.098-2.112). CONCLUSION: DM is the independent riskfactor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and combined end events inpatients with nonvalvular AF, while not a predictor for the occurrence of stroke.

 Clinical characteristics and impact of diabetes mellitus on outcomes in patientswith nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. ," PURPOSE: Studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor forcardiovascular disease, including atrial fibrillation (AF); however, the clinicalcharacteristics and prognostic impact of DM in patients with nonvalvular AF havenot been well understood in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Included were 1644consecutive patients with nonvalvular AF. Endpoints included all-cause mortality,cardiovascular mortality, stroke, major bleeding, and combined endpoint events(CEE) during a 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: The prevalence of DM was 16.8% innonvalvular AF patients. Compared with non-diabetic AF patients, diabetic AFpatients were older and tended to coexist with other cardiovascular diseases.Most patients with DM (93.5%) were eligible for anticoagulation, as determined byCHADS2 scores. However, only 11.2% of patients received anticoagulation. During a1-year follow-up, the all-cause mortality and CEE rate in the DM group weresignificantly higher than those of the non-DM group, while the incidence ofstroke was comparable. After multivariate adjustments, DM was still anindependent risk factor for 1-year all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR)=1.558;95% confidence interval (CI) 1.126-2.156; p=0.007], cardiovascular mortality(HR=1.615; 95% CI 1.052-2.479; p=0.028), and CEE (HR=1.523; 95% CI 1.098-2.112;p=0.012), yet not for stroke (HR=1.119; 95% CI 0.724-1.728; p=0.614). CONCLUSION:DM is a common morbidity coexisting with nonvalvular AF and is associated with anincreased risk of 1-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and CEE.However, no increased risk of stroke was found during a 1-year follow-up inpatients with AF and DM.

 Diabetes and silent atrial fibrillation: A dangerous liaison? , Diabetic patients have higher risk of stroke when compared to non-diabetics andin 25% of patients the cause of stroke is unknown. Marfella et al hypothesizedthat subclinical episodes of atrial fibrillation may be a common etiologicfactor. 464 type-2 diabetic patients were compared to 240 health controls andwere followed-up for 37 months. Silent cerebral infarcts at baseline were morecommon among diabetic patients with silent AF (176 patients) when compared tonon-silent AF group (288 patients) (61% vs. 29%; p < 0.001) and was associatedwith higher number of stroke at follow-up. ,yes,new
" Diabetes mellitus, glycemic control, and risk of atrial fibrillation. "," BACKGROUND: Diabetes may be an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation.However, results from prior studies are in conflict, and no study has examineddiabetes duration or glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association ofdiabetes with risk of atrial fibrillation and to describe risk according todiabetes duration and glycemic control. DESIGN: A population-based case-controlstudy. PARTICIPANTS: Within a large, integrated healthcare delivery system, weidentified 1,410 people with newly-recognized atrial fibrillation from ICD-9codes and validated cases by review of medical records. 2,203 controls withoutatrial fibrillation were selected from enrollment lists, stratified on age, sex,hypertension, and calendar year. MAIN MEASURES: Information on atrialfibrillation, diabetes and other characteristics came from medical records.Diabetes was defined based on physician diagnoses recorded in the medical record,and pharmacologically treated diabetes was defined as receiving antihyperglycemicmedications. Information about hemoglobin A1c levels came from computerizedlaboratory data. KEY RESULTS: Among people with atrial fibrillation, 252/1410(17.9%) had pharmacologically treated diabetes compared to 311/2203 (14.1%) ofcontrols. The adjusted OR for atrial fibrillation was 1.40 (95% CI 1.15-1.71) forpeople with treated diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Among those withtreated diabetes, the risk of developing atrial fibrillation was 3% higher foreach additional year of diabetes duration (95% CI 1-6%). Compared to peoplewithout diabetes, the adjusted OR for people with treated diabetes with averagehemoglobin A1c <or=7 was 1.06 (95% CI 0.74-1.51); for A1c >7 but <or=8, 1.48(1.09-2.01); for A1c >8 but <or=9, 1.46 (1.02-2.08); and for A1c >9, 1.96(1.22-3.14). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was associated with higher risk of developingatrial fibrillation, and risk was higher with longer duration of treated diabetesand worse glycemic control. Future research should identify and test approachesto reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation in people with diabetes. ",yes,new
 Diabetic atrial fibrillation patients: mortality and risk for stroke or embolismduring a 10-year follow-up. ," BACKGROUND: To compare in atrial fibrillation patients with and without diabetes,(1) baseline characteristics, (2) additional risk factors for stroke orperipheric or visceral embolism (hypertension, previous stroke, age >75 years),(3) mortality, (4) stroke or embolism, and (5) oral anticoagulation in the year2000. METHODS: Included were 409 outpatients with nonrheumatic atrialfibrillation (62 +/- 12 years, 36% female). All underwent transthoracic andtransesophageal echocardiography. Patients with thrombi received oralanticoagulation; patients without thrombi received aspirin until the follow-up in1995; afterwards, oral anticoagulation according to risk factors for stroke orembolism was recommended. Patients were contacted during the year 2000. RESULTS:Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 73 patients (18%). Sixteen (22%) diabetic and169 (50%) nondiabetic patients had no other risk factors for stroke or embolism(p < 0.0001). Diabetic patients were older, had more frequent heart failure,hypertension, myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, valvularabnormalities, left atrial or appendage thrombi, larger left atria, and leftatrial appendages than nondiabetic patients. Mean follow-up was 115 months.Diabetic patients had a higher mortality than nondiabetic patients (7%/yearversus 4%/year, p < 0.0001). The rate of stroke or embolism of diabetic (3%/year)and nondiabetic patients (2%/year) was similar. The rate of oral anticoagulationwas higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients (p = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS:Diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation frequently have additional riskfactors for stroke or embolism, and thus should be treated with oralanticoagulation. Whether in the rare cases of atrial fibrillation, in whomdiabetes is the only clinical risk factor, oral anticoagulation is indicatedcannot be answered by the present study. ",yes,new

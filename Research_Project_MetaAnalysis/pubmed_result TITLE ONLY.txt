AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of developing
      several cardiovascular complications. To our knowledge, the independent
      association between type 1 diabetes and atrial fibrillation has not been studied.
      METHODS: We did a prospective case-control study of individuals with type 1
      diabetes in the Swedish National Diabetes Registry who were each matched with
      five controls for age, sex, and county of residence who were randomly selected
      from the Swedish Population Register. Cases of atrial fibrillation were obtained 
      from the Swedish National Patient Registry. FINDINGS: We followed up 36 258
      patients with type 1 diabetes and 179 980 controls between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec
      31, 2013. Median follow-up was 9.7 years (IQR 5.2-13.0) for patients and 10.2
      years (5.7-13.0) for controls. 749 (2%) individuals with type 1 diabetes and 2882
      (2%) controls were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, with an adjusted hazard
      ratio (HR) of 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.25; p=0.029) in men and 1.50 (1.30-1.72;
      p<0.0001) in women (p=0.0019 for interaction). The excess risk of atrial
      fibrillation in individuals with type 1 diabetes increased with worsening
      glycaemic control and renal complications. Among individuals with
      normoalbuminuria, no excess risk of atrial fibrillation was noted in men with
      type 1 diabetes who had HbA1c lower than 9.7% (<83 mmol/mol) or in women with
      type 1 diabetes who had HbA1c lower than 8.8% (<73 mmol/mol). INTERPRETATION:
      Compared with the general population, the risk of atrial fibrillation in men with
      type 1 diabetes was slightly raised, whereas for female patients it was 50%
      higher. The risk of atrial fibrillation in people with type 1 diabetes increased 
      with renal complications and poor glycaemic control. FUNDING: Novo Nordisk

TI  - Hyperuricemia is associated with an increased prevalence of paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation in patients with type 2 diabetes referred for clinically indicated
      24-h Holter monitoring.
LID - 10.1007/s40618-017-0729-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Several studies have reported an association between hyperuricemia and
      increased risk of permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with and without
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Currently, no published data are available on
      the relationship between hyperuricemia and risk of paroxysmal AF. METHODS: We
      retrospectively evaluated 245 T2DM outpatients without pre-existing AF, cancer,
      cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease, who underwent a 24-h ECG-Holter monitoring
      for various clinical indications. Hyperuricemia was defined as a serum uric acid 
      level >7 mg/dl for men and >6 mg/dl for women or allopurinol use. The diagnosis
      of paroxysmal AF was confirmed in affected individuals on the basis of 24-h
      ECG-Holter monitoring by experienced cardiologists. RESULTS: Hyperuricemia was
      observed in 59 (24.1%) patients, whereas paroxysmal AF was found in 11 (4.5%)
      patients. The prevalence of paroxysmal AF was higher in patients with
      hyperuricemia than in those without hyperuricemia (10.2 vs. 2.7%, p = 0.026).
      Logistic regression analysis showed that hyperuricemia was associated with an
      increased risk of prevalent paroxysmal AF. This association remained significant 
      even after adjustment for age, metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease
      (adjusted-odds ratio 4.01, 95% CI 1.08-14.9; p = 0.039). Similar results were
      found when we used serum uric acid levels as a continuous measure. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study shows for the first time that hyperuricemia is independently
      associated with an approximately fourfold increased risk of prevalent paroxysmal 
      AF in patients with T2DM. These findings may partly explain the increased risk of
      permanent atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular death observed among patients
      with hyperuricemia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are common
      worldwide and their incidence is increasing, representing a significant public
      health and economic burden as well as an increase in individual increased
      morbidity and mortality risk profiles. Both conditions are closely related, as
      patients with DM are at increased risk of incident AF, and AF patients with DM
      are at higher risk of cardiovascular events compared to non-AF patients. Areas
      covered: This review article aims to provide an overview of the current evidence 
      linking DM and AF, as well as the impact of obesity, weight loss and stroke on
      these coexisting conditions. Second, the effects of new oral anti hyperglycaemic 
      medications on cardiovascular risk will be considered. Expert opinion: In
      conclusion, coexisting AF and DM represent a high risk population of patients
      requiring aggressive risk factor identification and treatment optimisation. The
      multifactorial interplay between these conditions requires individual assessment 
      of patient risk profiles with the aim of minimising the impact of each modifiable
      risk factor.

TI  - Pioglitazone attenuates atrial remodeling and vulnerability to atrial
      fibrillation in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits.
LID - 10.1111/1755-5922.12284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recent evidence indicates that peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor (PPAR)-gamma activators exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant
      actions. However, the underlying mechanisms by which these agents prevent atrial 
      remodeling in diabetes are not completely elucidated. We sought to investigate
      the potential effects of pioglitazone, a PPAR-gamma activator, on atrial
      remodeling and atrial fibrillation (AF) inducibility in diabetic rabbits.
      METHODS: Alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits were randomly divided into three
      groups: diabetes only, diabetes treated with low-dose pioglitazone (4 mg/day/kg),
      or diabetes treated with high dose pioglitazone (8 mg/day/kg) (n = 24 for each
      group). A total of 24 healthy rabbits serving as controls. Eight weeks later,
      hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and electrophysiological parameters were
      recorded. Left atrial whole-cell patch-clamp studies, histological examination
      and western-blot analysis were also performed. RESULTS: In the DM group (6/8 vs. 
      1/8, P < 0.05), higher AF inducibility, increased amount of fibrosis, lower INa ,
      and higher ICaL were observed in the DM group compared to controls. Western-blot 
      analysis showed that DM increased the expression of extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), phosphorylation ERK (pERK), transforming growth
      factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappaB p50 
      (NF-kappaB p50), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). All of these
      electrophysiological, histological, ion current density and protein expression
      changes were all reduced by pioglitazone. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone attenuates
      diabetes-induced structural and electrophysiological remodeling in the atria,
      thereby reducing the vulnerability to AF. This article is protected by copyright.

      of combined use of warfarin and statins in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF)
      with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), or hypertension. The
      effects of adding statins to warfarin were compared with those of warfarin alone 
      in patients with NVAF with the data set of J-RHYTHM Registry, a prospective,
      observational study with a 2-year follow-up. End points included thromboembolism,
      major hemorrhage, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Of 7,406
      patients with NVAF and follow-up data, 6,404 patients received warfarin at
      baseline. Of these, 1,605 patients also received a statin. Patients in the
      warfarin plus statin group showed significantly lower all-cause mortality
      compared with those on warfarin alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 0.38 to 0.87, p = 0.0089), although thromboembolic event rates did 
      not differ significantly (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.20, p = 0.21). In contrast,
      in 1,223 patients with DM, the warfarin plus statin group showed significantly
      lower thromboembolic event rates than the warfarin-alone group (HR 0.33, 95% CI
      0.11 to 0.96, p = 0.041). Interestingly, in patients with coronary artery disease
      or with hypertension, the addition of statin to warfarin did not decrease the
      frequency of thromboembolic events. In conclusion, in Japanese patients with NVAF
      with DM, a combination of warfarin and a statin could be clinically beneficial
      for preventing thromboembolic events.

TI  - Effect of ramipril/hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril/canrenone combination on
      atrial fibrillation recurrence in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with and 
      without cardiac autonomic neuropathy.
PG  - 550-557

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of
      ramipril/canrenone versus ramipril/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination on
      atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence in type 2 diabetic hypertensives with and
      without cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 289 
      hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, 95 with CAN, in sinus rhythm but with at
      least two episodes of AF in the previous 6 months were randomized to ramipril 5
      mg plus canrenone 50 mg (titrated to 10/100 mg) or to ramipril 5 mg plus HCTZ
      12.5 mg (titrated to 10/25 mg) or to amlodipine 5 mg (titrated to 10 mg) for 1
      year. Clinic blood pressure (BP) and a 24-h ECG were evaluated monthly. Patients 
      were asked to report any episode of symptomatic AF and to perform an ECG as early
      as possible. Serum procollagen type I carboxy-terminal peptide (PIP) and
      carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP) were evaluated before and 
      after each treatment period. RESULTS: Blood pressure was similarly and
      significantly reduced by all treatments. A total of 51% of patients with
      amlodipine had a recurrence of AF, as did 31% of patients with ramipril/HCTZ (p <
      0.05 vs. amlodipine) and 13% of patients with ramipril/canrenone (p < 0.01 vs.
      amlodipine and p < 0.05 vs. ramipril/HCTZ). A similar trend was found in diabetic
      patients with CAN. Both combinations reduced PIP and increased CITP, but the
      effects of ramipril/canrenone were significantly more marked. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings suggest that in type 2 diabetic hypertensives, ramipril/canrenone
      treatment was more effective than ramipril/HCTZ in reducing AF recurrence. This
      could be related to the greater improvement in cardiac fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We reviewed trends from 2004 to 2013 in the incidence and outcomes
      for atrial fibrillation (AF) in Spanish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) comparing women and men. METHODS: We used national hospital discharge data
      including all T2DM patients discharged from the hospital after AF. Patients with 
      AF in the primary diagnosis field were selected. Discharges were grouped by sex. 
      Incidence was calculated overall and stratified by sex. We analyzed diagnostic
      and therapeutic procedures, patient comorbidities, CHA2DS2-VASc score, length of 
      hospital stay, readmission rates and in-hospital mortality (IHM). RESULTS: We
      identified a total of 214,457 admissions for AF. Patients with T2DM accounted for
      21.1% (19,505 men and 25,954 women). Women with T2DM had a significantly higher
      incidence of AF compared to men over the study period (IRR 1.33;95%CI 1.31-1.35).
      Women were significantly older (77.24+/-8.69years) than men (72.62+/-10.28years),
      had higher prevalences of obesity and hypertension, and higher CHA2DS2-VASc
      score. Women less frequently underwent ablation (3.21% vs. 1.54%; p<0.001) and
      received an implanted pacemaker (14.3% vs. 8.16%; p<0.001) than men. Crude IHM
      was 2.81% for women and 2.48% for men (p=0.030). Sex was not associated with a
      higher IHM after multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates an
      increase in hospitalization for AF in diabetic women. Women were older, had a
      higher comorbidity index and had CHAD2DS2-VASc score than men. Women with AF and 
      T2DM undergo ablation or pacemaker implantation less frequently than their male
      counterparts. After multivariable adjustment sex did not predict mortality during
      admissions for AF.

      Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack [Doubled], Vascular 
      Disease, Age 65-74, Female) for Stroke in Asian Patients With Atrial

PG  - 1524-1530

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The CHA2DS2-VASc stroke score (congestive heart failure, 
      hypertension, age >/=75 (doubled), diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient
      ischemic attack (doubled), vascular disease, age 65-74, female) is used in most
      guidelines for risk stratification in atrial fibrillation (AF), but most data for
      this score have been derived in Western populations. Ethnic differences in stroke
      risk may be present. Our objective was to investigate risk factors for stroke in 
      AF and application of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in an Asian AF population from
      Korea. METHODS: A total of 5855 oral anticoagulant-naive nonvalvular AF patients 
      aged >/=20 years were enrolled from Korea National Health Insurance Service
      Sample cohort from 2002 to 2008 and were followed up until December 2013.
      RESULTS: The incidence rates (per 100 person-years) of ischemic stroke were 3.32 
      in the total population, being 0.23 in low-risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score 0 [male] or 1
      [female]) and 4.59 in high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc >/=2). Incidence rates of 
      ischemic stroke or the composite thromboembolism end point showed a clear
      increase with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc score. On multivariable analysis,
      significant associations between CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors and ischemic stroke
      were observed; however, the significance of vascular disease or diabetes mellitus
      was attenuated after multivariate adjustment, and female sex (hazard ratio, 0.73;
      95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.84) had a lower risk of ischemic stroke than
      males. Patients who were categorized as low risk consistently had an event rate
      <1% per year. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of CHA2DS2-VASc score in Asians is
      comparable with that in Western populations. The score shows good performance in 
      defining the truly-low-risk AF patients for stroke/thromboembolism.

      clinical and epidemiological association beyond the thromboembolic risk].
PG  - 199-207
LID - 10.1714/2674.27397 [doi]
AB  - A large number of studies have linked diabetes mellitus (DM) to the development
      of cardiovascular disease. However, the association between DM and arrhythmic
      disease of the heart is less well recognized by the cardiology community. Mostly,
      the focus is the increased thromboembolic risk that the presence of DM confers to
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, recent evidence points toward an
      increased prevalence of AF in patients with diabetes. This association seems to
      be reinforced by the presence of additional comorbidities such as hypertension
      and insulin-resistance. Moreover, different pathophysiological mechanisms support
      this association. Notably the link between AF and DM is bidirectional: not only
      patients with DM are more vulnerable to develop AF but also patients with
      new-onset AF have an increased risk of DM. Herein, the epidemiological findings
      and pathophysiological mechanisms linking AF and DM will be reviewed in order to 
      increase the knowledge on this association and improve the clinical and
      therapeutic approach.

TI  - Thiazolidinedione use and atrial fibrillation in diabetic patients: a
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/s12872-017-0531-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that thiazolidinediones (TZDs) may
      exert protective effects in atrial fibrillation (AF). The present meta-analysis
      investigated the association between TZD use and the incidence of AF in diabetic 
      patients. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched until December 2016. Of the
      346 initially identified records, 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 4
      observational studies with 130,854 diabetic patients were included in the final
      analysis. RESULTS: Pooled analysis of the included studies demonstrated that
      patients treated with TZDs had approximately 30% lower risk of developing AF
      compared to controls [odds ratio (OR): 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62
      to 0.87, p = 0.0003]. This association was consistently observed for both new
      onset AF (OR =0.77, p = 0.002) and recurrent AF (OR =0.41, p = 0.002),
      pioglitazone use (OR =0.56, p = 0.04) but not rosiglitazone use (OR =0.78, p =
      0.12). The association between TZD use and AF incidence was not significant in
      the pooled analysis of three RCTs (OR =0.77, 95% CI = 0.53-1.12, p = 0.17), but
      was significantly in the pooled analysis of the four observational studies (OR
      =0.71, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that TZDs may confer
      protection against AF in the setting of diabetes mellitus (DM). This class of
      drugs can be used as upstream therapy for DM patients to prevent the development 
      of AF. Further large-scale RCTs are needed to determine whether TZDs use could
      prevent AF in the setting of DM.

LID - 10.1097/HPC.0000000000000103 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the association of the preoperative hemoglobin A1c
      (HbA1c) with occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in type-2
      diabetic patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.
      METHODS: We prospectively studied 708 type-2 diabetes patients [433 men
      ([61.2%)], candidate for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. Biochemistry
      profile was measured on the day of operation. All patients were telemonitored for
      72 hours after operation for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. The role of
      HbA1c as a predictor for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation was then
      evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 109 (15.3%) patients developed POAF. Patients in
      the atrial fibrillation group tended to be older, with prolonged longer diabetes,
      and have renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension. 
      In the univariable and multivariable regression model, HbA1c was not a predictor 
      for POAF. CONCLUSIONS: Serum level of HbA1c could not be used as a predictor for 
      the development of POAF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a known risk predictor for thromboembolic events in
      patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but no study has explored the prognostic 
      weight of insulin in this setting. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the
      differential role of insulin versus no insulin therapy on thromboembolic risk in 
      patients with diabetes and AF. METHODS: We accessed individual patient data from 
      the prospective, real-world, multicenter, PREFER in AF (European Prevention of
      thromboembolic events-European Registry in Atrial Fibrillation). We compared the 
      rates of stroke/systemic embolism at 1 year according to diabetes status (no
      diabetes, diabetes without insulin therapy, diabetes on insulin therapy).
      RESULTS: In an overall population of 5,717 patients, 1,288 had diabetes, 22.4% of
      whom were on insulin. For patients with diabetes who were on insulin, there was a
      significantly increased risk of stroke/systemic embolism at 1 year versus either 
      no diabetes (5.2% vs. 1.9%; hazard ratio: 2.89; 95% confidence interval: 1.67 to 
      5.02; p = 0.0002) or diabetes without insulin treatment (5.2% vs. 1.8%; hazard
      ratio: 2.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.49 to 5.87; p = 0.0019). Notably, rates
      of stroke/embolism were similar in patients with diabetes not receiving insulin
      versus patients without diabetes (hazard ratio: 0.97; 95% confidence interval:
      0.58 to 1.61; p = 0.90). The selective predictive role of insulin-requiring
      diabetes was independent of potential confounders, including diabetes duration,
      and was maintained in various subpopulations, including the subgroup receiving
      anticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of anticoagulated patients
      with AF, the sole presence of diabetes not requiring insulin did not imply an
      increased thromboembolic risk. Conversely, insulin-requiring diabetes contributed
      most, if not exclusively, to the overall increase of thromboembolic risk in AF.

      Anticoagulants: A Review.
PG  - 442-448
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2016.5224 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is
      associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk for stroke. Type 2 diabetes is an
      independent risk factor for both stroke and atrial fibrillation, and in the
      setting of AF, type 2 diabetes is independently associated with a 2% to 3.5%
      increase in absolute stroke rate per year. The overlap in the pathophysiologies
      of AF and type 2 diabetes are not well understood, and current practice
      guidelines provide few recommendations regarding patients with both conditions.
      Observations: In this article, we review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of 
      the nexus of AF and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we analyze the subgroup of
      patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of non-vitamin 
      K antagonist oral anticoagulants in prevention of arterial thromboembolism in AF,
      highlighting the greater absolute benefit of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Finally, we offer recommendations on risk
      stratification and therapy for patients with concomitant AF and type 2 diabetes. 
      Conclusions and Relevance: We highlight the increased thromboembolic risk with
      coexisting AF and type 2 diabetes. We recommend that further studies be done to
      evaluate the potential benefits of anticoagulation for all patients who have both
      and the potential for non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants to have greater benefits 
      than risks over vitamin K antagonists.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common co-morbidity in those with nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation (NVAF). Most patients with DM and NVAF have a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 
      >/=1 and should be considered for oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke
      prevention per treatment guidelines. The most important risk associated with
      anticoagulation is bleeding, which may be higher in those with NVAF plus DM. Our 
      objective was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of major bleeding
      (MB) in rivaroxaban users diagnosed with NVAF, further comparing those with DM
      versus those without DM, in a real-world clinical setting. Electronic medical
      records of >10 million patients from the Department of Defense Military Health
      System were queried to identify rivaroxaban users with NVAF over a 2.5-year
      period. Major bleeding-related hospitalization was identified by a validated
      case-finding algorithm. Patient characteristics, incidence and management of MB, 
      and fatal outcomes were assessed by DM status. Of 44,793 rivaroxaban users with
      NVAF, 12,039 (26.9%) had DM, who were more likely men, younger, with more
      co-morbidity and higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores. Major bleeding incidence was higher 
      among those with DM compared with those without, 3.68 (95% confidence interval
      [CI] 3.37 to 4.03) versus 2.51 (95% CI 2.34 to 2.69) per 100 person-years, and
      intracranial bleeding incidence was 0.19 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.28) versus 0.25 (95%

      rivaroxaban users with NVAF, patients with DM had more co-morbidities and higher 
      incidence of MB compared with those without DM.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus
      warfarin in diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation: A study-level
      meta-analysis of phase III randomized trials.
LID - 10.1002/dmrr.2876 [doi]
AB  - In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the safety and efficacy of nonvitamin 
      K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) vs warfarin according to diabetes
      mellitus (DM) status are not completely characterized. We performed a
      meta-analysis to clarify whether in these patients the strategy of oral
      anticoagulation should be tailored to diabetes status. In this study-level
      meta-analysis, we included 4 randomized phase III trials comparing NOACs and
      warfarin in patients with nonvalvular AF; a total of 18 134 patients with DM and 
      40 454 without DM were overall considered. Incidence of the following outcome
      measures was evaluated during the follow-up: stroke or systemic embolism,
      ischemic stroke, major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and vascular death. Use
      of NOACs compared with warfarin reduced stroke/systemic embolism in diabetic
      (Risk Ratios [RR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.93; P = .004) and nondiabetic patients (RR 
      0.83, 0.73-0.93; P = .001) (P for interaction .72). No interaction between
      diabetes status and benefits of NOACs was found for the occurrence of ischemic
      stroke, major bleeding, or intracranial bleeding (P for interaction >.05 for each
      comparison). Reduction of vascular death rates with NOACs was significant in
      diabetic patients (4.97% vs 5.99% with warfarin; RR 0.83, 0.72-0.96; P = .01), in
      whom absolute the reduction of this outcome measure was higher than in
      nondiabetics (1.02% vs 0.27%), although no interaction was present (P = .23).
      Results of this meta-analysis support the safety and efficacy of NOACs compared
      with warfarin in diabetic patients with nonvalvular AF.

      with an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation in patients with type 2

AB  - AIMS: It is known that type 2 diabetic patients are at high risk of atrial
      fibrillation (AF). However, the early echocardiographic determinants of AF
      vulnerability in this patient population remain poorly known. METHODS: We
      followed-up for 2years a sample of 180 consecutive outpatients with type 2
      diabetes, who were free from AF and ischemic heart disease at baseline. All
      patients underwent a baseline echocardiographic-Doppler evaluation with tissue
      Doppler and 2-D strain analysis. Standard electrocardiograms were performed twice
      per year, and a diagnosis of incident AF was confirmed in affected patients by a 
      single cardiologist. RESULTS: Over the 2-year follow-up period, 14 (7.8%)
      patients developed incident AF. In univariate analyses, echocardiographic
      predictors of new-onset AF were greater indexed cardiac mass, larger indexed left
      atrial volume (LAVI), lower global longitudinal strain (LSSYS), lower global
      diastolic strain rate during early phase of diastole (SRE), lower global
      diastolic strain rate during late phase of diastole (SRL), and higher E/SRE
      ratio. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lower LSSYS remained
      the only significant predictor of new-onset AF (adjusted-odds ratio 1.63, 95%CI
      1.17-2.27; p<0.005) after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, indexed
      cardiac mass and LAVI. Results were unchanged even after adjustment for body mass
      index, hypertension and glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      prospective study to show that early LSSYS impairment independently predicts the 
      risk of new-onset AF in type 2 diabetic patients with preserved ejection fraction
      and without ischemic heart disease. Future larger prospective studies are needed 
      to confirm these findings.

TI  - High plasma level of soluble RAGE is independently associated with a low
      recurrence of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation in diabetic patient.
PG  - 1711-1718
AB  - AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, and
      the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) pathway is involved in
      insulin resistance and cardiac remodelling. We hypothesized that plasma level of 
      soluble RAGE (sRAGE) would predict clinical outcome after radiofrequency catheter
      ablation for AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured pre-procedural plasma level of 
      sRAGE in 496 patients who underwent AF ablation (142 patients with diabetes, 354 
      patients without diabetes selected by matching them with diabetic patients
      according to age, sex, and AF type). (i) Plasma level of sRAGE was significantly 
      higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics (580.0 +/- 576.4 vs. 435.8 +/- 
      280.7 pg/mL, P = 0.005), but there was no difference in sRAGE levels between
      patients with clinical recurrence of AF and those without. (ii) During 24.5 +/-
      18.0 months of follow-up, the recurrence of AF was significantly lower in the
      diabetic patient group with high sRAGE (>/=418 pg/mL based on the median value)
      than the diabetic patient group with low sRAGE (log-rank P = 0.045). This was
      especially pronounced in patients with paroxysmal AF and diabetes (log-rank P =
      0.016), but no association was found in non-diabetics. (iii) In multivariate Cox 
      regression analysis, high sRAGE (HR 0.395, 95% CI 0.175-0.894, P = 0.026) and
      paroxysmal AF (HR 0.387, 95% CI 0.179-0.835, P = 0.016) were independently
      associated with the favourable clinical outcome of rhythm control after AF
      ablation in diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: High plasma level of sRAGE was
      independently associated with low AF recurrence after catheter ablation in
      diabetic patients, especially those with paroxysmal AF.

TI  - QTc interval predicts outcome of catheter ablation in paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 646-652
AB  - Catheter ablation has been recommended as a treatment option for paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation (PAF) patients complicated with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). PAF patients with T2DM have a higher recurrence rate after catheter
      ablation. Prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interval has been linked to poor
      outcomes in T2DM patients. Whether the abnormal QTc interval is associated with
      the ablation outcome in the PAF patients with T2DM remains unknown. In this
      study, 134 PAF patients with T2DM undergoing primary catheter ablation were
      retrospectively enrolled. Pre-procedural QTc interval was corrected by using the 
      Bazett's formula. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to assess the 
      relationship between QTc interval and the recurrence of AF. After a 29.1-month
      follow-up period, 61 patients experienced atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence.
      Recurrent patients had a longer QTc interval than non-recurrent patients
      (425.2+/-21.5 ms vs. 414.1+/-13.4 ms, P=0.002). Multivariate Cox regression
      analysis revealed that QTc interval [hazard ratio (HR)=1.026, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 1.012-1.040, P=0.005] and left atrial diameter (LAD) (HR=1.125, 95%
      CI 1.062-1.192, P=0.003) were independent predictors of recurrent atrial
      tachyarrhythmia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that the
      cut-off value of QTc (418 ms) predicted arrhythmia recurrence with a sensitivity 
      of 55.7% and a specificity of 69.9%. A combination of LAD and QTc was more
      effective than LAD alone (P<0.001) in predicting arrhythmia recurrence after the 
      procedure. QTc interval could be used as an independent predictor of arrhythmia
      recurrence in T2DM patients undergoing AF ablation, thus providing a simple
      method to identify those patients who likely have a better outcome following the 
      procedure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent among type 2 diabetic patients.
      However, the association between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and AF is
      controversial. METHODS: We included 40,500 patients with type 2 diabetes
      (>/=40years, mean age 62+/-11years, 53% men) without AF from the Korean National 
      Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2002-2007). Subjects were classified
      without DR (non-DR, n=30,178), with DR (DR, n=8920), and with proliferative DR
      (PDR, n=1402). RESULTS: During a mean 5.9-year follow-up, 1261 (3.1%) patients
      were newly diagnosed as having AF (4.9, 6.0, and 8.3 per 1000 person-years in the
      non-DR, DR, and PDR groups, respectively). In multivariate Cox proportional
      hazard models, patients in the DR and PDR groups had a significantly higher risk 
      of AF than those in the non-DR group (DR group: hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.30; PDR group: HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.87); p for 
      trend <0.001). The risk of AF increased in patients with DR and end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.31-3.96, p<0.001) and in those with PDR and
      ESRD (HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.96-5.97, p<0.001) compared to those without DR and ESRD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence and severity of DR was significantly associated with
      the incidence of AF. Also, the presence of ESRD had an impact on the incidence of
      AF in patients with DR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics and impact of diabetes
      mellitus (DM) on prognosis in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF).
      METHODS: Data of nonvalvular AF patients in the Chinese Emergency Atrial
      Fibrillation Registry Study were retrospectively analyzed. The eligible patients 
      were divided into the DM group and the non-DM group. Uni- and multi-variate Cox
      regression analysis were used to explore risk factors of 1-year outcomes.
      RESULTS: A total of 1 644 patients were enrolled in the study with 227 patients
      combined with DM (16.8%). Compared with non-DM group, patients with DM were older
      and had higher body weight, had higher prevalence of myocardial infarction,
      coronary heart disease, hypertension and stroke, and were at higher risk of
      thromboembolism. The proportion of anticoagulant treatment was low in both groups
      (10.1% vs 7.4%, P=0.141). Compared with patients without DM, patients with DM had
      higher all-cause mortality (19.5% vs 12.7%, P=0.004), cardiovascular death (10.8%
      vs 7.02%, P=0.047) and combined end events (CEE, 26.4% vs 2.4%, P=0.023), while
      with comparable incidence of stroke (10.1% vs 7.4%, P=0.141). Multi-variate Cox
      regression analysis showed that DM was an independent risk factor for 1-year
      all-cause mortality (HR=1.558, 95% CI 1.126-2.156), cardiovascular death
      (HR=1.615, 95% CI 1.052-2.479) and CEE (HR=1.523, 95% CI 1.098-2.112), while not 
      for stroke (HR=1.523, 95% CI 1.098-2.112). CONCLUSION: DM is the independent risk
      factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and combined end events in
      patients with nonvalvular AF, while not a predictor for the occurrence of stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To describe trends in the incidence and outcomes for atrial
      fibrillation (AF) in patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in Spain
      between 2004 and 2013. METHODS: We used national hospital discharge data to
      select all patients discharged from hospital after AF. We focused our analysis on
      patients with AF in the primary diagnosis field. Discharges were grouped by
      diabetes status (diabetic or non-diabetic). Incidence was calculated overall and 
      stratified by diabetes status. We analyzed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures,
      patient comorbidities, CHA2DS2-VASc score, length of hospital stay and
      in-hospital mortality (IHM). RESULTS: We identified a total of 214,457 admissions
      for AF (21.1% with T2DM). The incidence was higher among people with T2DM. Women 
      with T2DM have significant higher incidence than men in all years studied. T2DM
      was positively associated with AF hospitalization (IRR 3.76, 95%CI 3.72-3.80).
      T2DM patients were significantly older than patients without diabetes, had more
      comorbidity and had higher values of CHA2DS2-VASc score. Prevalence of
      dyslipidemia and hypertension were almost 50% higher and prevalence of obesity
      was two times higher (all p values<0.05). Diabetes was not associated with a
      higher IHM (OR: 0.99, 95%CI 0.93-1.06). For the entire sample, time trend
      analyses showed a significant decrease in mortality in patients admitted for AF
      (OR: 0.98, 95%CI 0.97-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence rates were higher in T2DM
      patients. Women with T2DM have significant higher incidence rates than men. The
      presence of diabetes is not associated with a higher IHM during admission for AF.

      nationwide cohort study.
PG  - e3992
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000003992 [doi]
AB  - Conventional stroke risk prediction tools used in atrial fibrillation (AF)
      incorporate the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) as a risk factor. However, it 
      is unknown whether this risk is homogenous or dependent on the presence of
      diabetic microvascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, 
      and neuropathy. The present study examined the risk of ischemic stroke in
      diabetic patients with and without microvascular complications. The present study
      used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan with detailed
      healthcare data on all-comers to the Taiwanese medical system from January 1,
      1996 to December 31, 2011. AF and DM were identified when listed as discharge
      diagnoses or confirmed more than twice in the outpatient department. Patients on 
      antithrombotic agents were excluded. The clinical endpoint was ischemic stroke.
      Among the 50,180 AF patients with DM, the majority had no microvascular
      complications (72.7%), while 2.6% had diabetic retinopathy, 8.4% had diabetic
      nephropathy, and 16.1% had diabetic neuropathy. Ischemic stroke occurred in 6003 
      patients, with a 4.74% annual risk of ischemic stroke. When compared with DM
      patients without microvascular complications, those with diabetic retinopathy,
      nephropathy, or neuropathy had higher incidences of ischemic stroke (4.65 vs
      5.07, 4.77, or 5.20 per 100 person-years, respectively). However, after adjusting
      for confounding factors, the differences were no longer significant. In a large
      nationwide AF cohort with DM, risk of ischemic stroke was similar between
      patients with and without microvascular complications, suggesting that risk
      stratification of these patients does not require inclusion of diabetic
      retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.

TI  - CHA2DS2-VASc score is useful in predicting poor 12-month outcomes following
      myocardial infarction in diabetic patients without atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 807-15
LID - 10.1007/s00592-016-0877-6 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: TIMI risk score and GRACE risk model are widely available and accepted
      scores for risk assessment in STEMI patients and include predictors of poor
      outcomes. CHA2DS2-VASc is a validated score for predicting embolic/stroke risk in
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Its components contribute to the 
      worse prognosis following myocardial infarction. The advantage of the
      CHA2DS2-VASc score in comparison with other risk scores is that it provides a
      comprehensive, fast, and simple method for physicians in risk evaluation that
      requires no calculators or computers. Therefore, we have set out to examine the
      prognostic significance of CHA2DS2-VASc score following STEMI in diabetic
      patients without AF. METHODS: A total of 472 patients with diabetes mellitus and 
      STEMI undergoing primary PCI were enrolled. Based on the estimated CHA2DS2-VASc
      score, the study population was divided into three groups: group 1 (N = 111) with
      a moderate CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or 3; group 2 (N = 257) with a high
      CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4 or 5; and group 3 (N = 104) with a very high CHA2DS2-VASc
      score of 6 or higher. RESULTS: In diabetic patients with STEMI, the median of
      CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4 (interquartile range 3-5). In-hospital mortality rate
      was similar across three groups. CHA2DS2-VASc score was not a risk factor of
      in-hospital mortality. ROC analysis revealed good diagnostic value of
      CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting long-term mortality (AUC 0.62 95 % CI 0.57-0.66 
      P = 0.0003) and stroke (AUC 0.75 95 % CI 0.71-0.79 P = 0.0003), but no value in
      predicting long-term myocardial infarction. CHA2DS2-VASc score was an independent
      predictor of 12-month mortality and stroke. One-point increment in CHA2DS2-VASc
      score was associated with an increase in the risk of 12-month death by 24 % and
      for 12-month stroke by 101 %. CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic patients with STEMI and no
      previous AF, median CHA2DS2-VASc score was high (4 points) and predicted 12-month
      death and stroke. However, it failed to predict in-hospital death and 12-month
      MI. CHA2DS2-VASc score had a similar discrimination performance in predicting
      12-month mortality as TIMI risk score and a better discrimination performance in 
      predicting 12-month stroke than TIMI risk score. Thus, it can serve as an
      additive tool in identifying high-risk patients that require aggressive
      management.

AB  - AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To explore the association between atrial fibrillation (AF)
      and diabetes mellitus in a general Chinese population, and the influence of
      hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2013 to August 2013, we carried
      out a cross-sectional study involving 11,956 permanent residents aged >/=35 years
      from the general population in the Liaoning province of China (response rate
      85.3%). Each participant completed a questionnaire, had a physical examination,
      and underwent an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. AF was diagnosed on the
      basis of the electrocardiogram findings. Logistic regression analyses were
      carried out to estimate the associations between diabetes mellitus and AF. The
      associations were also analyzed in hypertensive and normotensive subgroups.
      RESULTS: There was a higher prevalence of AF in participants with diabetes
      mellitus than those without diabetes mellitus (1.2 vs 0.5%; P = 0.004). In the
      hypertensive subgroup, the prevalence of AF in participants with diabetes
      mellitus was significantly higher than in participants without diabetes mellitus 
      (1.5 vs 0.6%; P = 0.008); however, the prevalences were similar in the
      normotensive subgroup (0.3 vs 0.4%; P = 1.000). Similar trends were present in
      both men and women. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, the
      independent association between diabetes mellitus and AF remained in the total
      sample (odds ratio 2.33, 95% confidence interval 1.20-4.54) and hypertensive
      subgroup (odds ratio 3.15, 95% confidence interval 1.52-6.56), but not in the
      normotensive subgroup (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.08-5.31).
      CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for AF in the
      general population in China, this association was present in total and
      hypertensive participants, but not in normotensive participants.

TI  - Calpain-Calcineurin-Nuclear Factor Signaling and the Development of Atrial
      Fibrillation in Patients with Valvular Heart Disease and Diabetes.
PG  - 4639654
LID - 10.1155/2016/4639654 [doi]
AB  - Calpain, calcineurin (CaN), and nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) play a 
      key role in the development of atrial fibrillation. Patients with valvular heart 
      disease (VHD) are prone to develop atrial fibrillation (AF). Thus, our current
      study was aimed at investigating whether activation of calpain-CaN-NFAT pathway
      is associated with the incidence of AF in the patients with VHD and diabetes. The
      expressions of calpain 2 and alpha- and beta-isoforms of CaN catalytic subunit
      (CnA) as well as NFAT-c3 and NFAT-c4 were quantified by quantitative reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction in atrial tissues from 77 hospitalized
      patients with VHD and diabetes. The relevant protein content was measured by
      Western blot and calpain 2 in human atrium was localized by immunohistochemistry.
      We found that the expressions of calpain 2, CnA alpha and CnA beta, and NFAT-c3
      but not NFAT-c4 were significantly elevated in the samples from patients with AF 
      compared to those with sinus rhythm (SR). Elevated protein levels of calpain 2
      and CnA were observed in patients with AF, and so was the enhanced localization
      of calpain 2. We thereby concluded that CaN together with its upstream molecule, 
      calpain 2, and its downstream effector, NFAT-c3, might contribute to the
      development of AF in patients with VHD and diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease and arrhythmias. Procedural data and complication rates in
      patients with DM undergoing catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmias are unknown.
      METHODS: The German Ablation Registry has been designed as a multi-center
      prospective registry. Between January 2007 and January 2010 data from ablation of
      right atrial flutter (AFlut) and atrial fibrillation (AF) were collected from 51 
      German centres. Patients with DM and without DM were compared. RESULTS: We
      included 8175 patients who underwent catheter ablation of AFlut or AF. Patients
      with DM (n=944) were older and presented significantly more severe comorbidities.
      Major periprocedural complications did not significantly differ between patients 
      with and without DM for both ablation of AFlut and AF. Kaplan-Meier survival
      analysis for 366days of follow-up, showed a significant increase of MACCE for DM 
      patients as compared to controls after AFlut [6.1% vs. 3.4%(p=0.002)], but not
      after AF ablation [1.2% vs. 0.9%(p=0.59)]. Ablation of AFlut led to a comparable 
      reduction of palpitations and NYHA class in both patient groups. AF ablation
      reduced palpitations and NYHA class in patients without DM, while patients with
      DM reported no improvement of NYHA class despite a reduction of palpitations.
      CONCLUSION: As compared to non-DM, patients with DM show no increased
      periprocedural risk and no increased arrhythmia recurrence after ablation of
      AFlut or AF. As expected patients with DM exhibit more comorbidities and an
      increased ongoing mortality after atrial flutter ablation presumably caused by
      the higher age of this group as compared to controls.

LID - 10.12669/pjms.321.8588 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus is recognized as a risk factor for mortality and
      morbidity after coronary bypass grafting. We aimed to determine the association
      between preoperative hemoglobin HbA1c and AF after isolated off-pump coronary
      bypass grafting (OPCAB). METHODS: The seventy-two diabetic patients undergoing
      isolated off-pump coronary bypass grafting were retrospectively analyzed for AF. 
      They were divided into; Low (4.8-5.4%), Medium (5.5-8%) and High (8.1-11.5%)
      groups. The three groups were compared with respect to demographic,
      echocardiographic, intraoperative and postoperative clinical characteristics
      correlation. RESULTS: Three patients died during postoperative period. AF
      occurred in 12 patients (16.6%) after surgery. The incidence of postoperative AF 
      was 15.3% in the lower, 4.4% middle and 57.1% upper group. There was
      statistically significant correlation between preoperative HbA1C and preoperative
      stroke, preoperative MI history, Left atrial (LA) size, preoperative
      levosimendan, preoperative clopidogrel, postoperative AF, postoperative dopamine 
      and dobutamine use, IABP, duration of extubation time, 24-hour chest tube
      drainage, duration of ICU and hospital mortality. Univariate logistic regression 
      analysis showed significant correlation between postoperative AF and variables
      like preoperative HbA1c levels, LVEF<30%, history of preoperative MI,
      preoperative use of levosimendan, preoperative use of clopidogrel, postoperative 
      dopamine, dobutamine adrenaline use, left atrium size, 24-hour chest tube
      drainage and length of stay in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Preoperative 
      HbA1c levels could predict the occurrence of postoperative AF in diabetic
      patients and may entail to administer protective strategies.

AB  - AIM: The association of diabetes with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) remains 
      controversial. Hypertension may partly explain the risk association ascribed to
      diabetes. We studied the role and characteristics of diabetes in hypertensive
      patients with no ischemic vascular disease. METHODS: Records of 262,892 persons
      from the Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care in
      Catalonia (Spain) were examined from July 2006 to December 2011. Included
      participants were >/=55-years-old and hypertensive with no ischemic heart
      disease, stroke, or peripheral artery disease. We used Cox proportional hazards
      regression to model incidences in the diabetic and non-diabetic subgroups of our 
      population, and among diabetic patients, diabetes duration and pharmacological
      treatment, hemoglobin A1C, and body mass index. RESULTS: New-onset AF incidence
      in diabetic patients was 13.3 per 1000 person-years (mean follow-up: 4.3 years). 
      In non-diabetic patients, it was 10.4 per 1000 person-years (mean follow-up: 4.1 
      years). Diabetes hazard ratio (HR) for new-onset AF was 1.11 (95% confidence
      interval (CI): 1.06-1.16). Diabetic patients also diagnosed with obesity had an
      HR of 1.41 (95% CI: 1.22-1.64). CONCLUSION: Diabetes was modestly associated with
      new-onset AF in hypertensive patients with no ischemic vascular disease. Among
      diabetic patients, only obesity reached significance in its association with this
      arrhythmia.

      atrial fibrillation: effect of diabetes.
PG  - 115-122
LID - 10.1111/1753-0407.12392 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is an important risk factor for ischemic stroke in
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of the present study was to
      evaluate temporal trends in ischemic stroke and warfarin use among US Medicare
      patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 
      1-year cohorts of patients with Medicare as the primary payer over the period
      1992-2010 were created using the Medicare 5% sample (excluding patients with
      valvular disease and end-stage renal disease). International Classification of
      Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes were used to
      identify AF, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and diabetes; three or more
      consecutive prothrombin time claims were used to identify warfarin use. RESULTS: 
      Demographic characteristics of subjects in 1992 (n = 40 255) and 2010 (n = 80
      314), respectively, were as follows: age 65-74 years, 37% and 32%; age >85 years,
      20% and 25%; White, 94% and 93%; hypertension, 46% and 80%; diabetes, 20% and
      32%; and chronic kidney disease, 5% and 18%. Among Medicare AF patients with
      diabetes, ischemic stroke decreased by 71% (1992-2010) from 65 to 19 per 1000
      patient-years; warfarin use increased from 28% to 62%. Among patients without
      diabetes, ischemic stroke decreased by 68% from 44 to 14 per 1000 patient-years, 
      whereas warfarin use increased from 26% to 59%. Approximately 38% of Medicare AF 
      patients with diabetes did not receive anticoagulation in 2010. CONCLUSIONS:
      Ischemic stroke declined and warfarin use increased similarly in Medicare
      patients with and without diabetes. Ischemic stroke rates were consistently
      higher in diabetes patients, validating the inclusion of diabetes in risk
      calculators. The population of Medicare patients with diabetes who did not
      receive warfarin deserves future attention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The risk of ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, and all-cause
      death among heart failure patients previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus is
      poorly described. We evaluated the risk of these endpoints among heart failure
      patients without diagnosed atrial fibrillation according to the presence of
      diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Population-based nationwide cohort study of
      non-anticoagulated patients diagnosed with incident heart failure during
      2000-2012, identified by record linkage between nationwide registries in Denmark.
      We calculated relative risks after 1year to evaluate the association between
      diabetes and risk of events in 39,357 heart failure patients, among whom 18.1%
      had diabetes. Analysis took into account competing risks of death. RESULTS:
      Absolute risks of all endpoints were higher in patients with diabetes compared to
      patients without diabetes after 1-year follow-up (ischemic stroke: 4.1% vs. 2.8%;
      systemic thromboembolism: 11.9% vs. 8.6%; all-cause death: 22.1% vs. 21.4%).
      Diabetes was significantly associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke
      (adjusted relative risk [RR]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.51);
      systemic thromboembolism (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.11-1.30); and all-cause death (RR: 
      1.17, 95% CI: 1.11-1.23). Additionally, time since diabetes diagnosis was
      associated with higher adjusted cumulative incidences of ischemic stroke,
      systemic thromboembolism, and all-cause death (p for trend, p<0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Among heart failure patients without atrial fibrillation, diabetes
      was associated with a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke, systemic
      thromboembolism, and all-cause death compared to those without diabetes, even
      after adjustment for concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. Increased focus on 
      secondary prevention in heart failure patients with diabetes may be warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the prevalence, incidence, risk factors and
      treatment (according to stroke risk) of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the national,
      population-based Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study
      cohort. METHODS: ECG data were available from 8273/11,247 participants of AusDiab
      study in 1999/2000 and from 5422 participants in 2004/2005. Minnesota coding was 
      used to identify prevalent and incident cases of AF. RESULTS: 90 prevalent cases 
      of AF (14.1 per 1000) comprising 56 men (mean age 70.5 +/- 1.9 years) and 34
      women (aged 78.3 +/- 1.2 years) were identified in 1999-2000. AF prevalence was
      associated with sedentary behaviour versus physically active (PR 2.0, 95% CI
      1.2-3.6). 53 incident cases of AF (2.0, 95%, CI 1.5-2.6 per 1000 person-year)
      were subsequently identified in 2004-2005. Increased risk of incident AF was
      associated with male sex, obesity, history of angina, myocardial infarction and
      stroke. Both increased weight gain and increased weight loss appeared to be
      associated with increased risks of developing AF in women, while no obvious
      association was observed in men. Despite their high risk for stroke,
      anti-thrombotic therapy was observed in only 39.3% of participants with
      CHA2DS2-VASC scores >/= 2. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to a better
      understanding of the AF burden. With the ageing population, coordinated efforts
      will be needed to anticipate the future health care costs related to AF and its
      impacts on the health care system. This will include appropriate application of
      anti-thrombotic therapy according to risk of thrombo-embolic events.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains the most frequent sustained cardiac arrhythmia
      worldwide and its incidence increases with ageing, cardiovascular risk factors
      and comorbidities. Prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is growing fast and is
      assuming pandemic proportions mostly due to overnutrition and sedentary habits.
      Experimental and clinical evidences suggest that DM and AF are strongly
      interconnected. The present review addresses in detail new molecular pathways
      implicated in the etiology of AF and their relevance for mechanism-based
      therapeutic strategies in this setting. Advances in risk stratification, drug
      therapy (i.e., novel anticoagulants) and catheter ablation are also described.

TI  - Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with diabetes mellitus: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1518-25
LID - 10.1093/europace/euv214 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and atrial fibrillation (AF) share
      pathophysiological links, as supported by the high prevalence of AF within DM
      patients. Catheter ablation of AF (AFCA) is an established therapeutic option for
      rhythm control in drug resistant symptomatic patients. Its efficacy and safety
      among patients with DM is based on small populations, and long-term outcome is
      unknown. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess safety
      and long-term outcome of AFCA in DM patients, focusing on predictors of
      recurrence. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic review was conducted in
      MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials, clinical
      trials, and observational studies including patients with DM undergoing AFCA were
      screened and included if matching inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fifteen
      studies were included, adding up to 1464 patients. Mean follow-up was 27 (20-33) 
      months. Overall complication rate was 3.5 (1.5-5.0)%. Efficacy in maintaining
      sinus rhythm at follow-up end was 66 (58-73)%. Meta-regression analysis revealed 
      that advanced age (P < 0.001), higher body mass index (P < 0.001), and higher
      basal glycated haemoglobin level (P < 0.001) related to higher incidence of
      arrhythmic recurrences. Performing AFCA lead to a reduction of patients requiring
      treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) from 55 (46-74)% at baseline to 29
      (17-41)% (P < 0.001) at follow-up end. CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation of AF
      safety and efficacy in DM patients is similar to general population, especially
      when performed in younger patients with satisfactory glycemic control. Catheter
      ablation of AF reduces the amount of patients requiring AADs, an additional
      benefit in this population commonly exposed to adverse effects of AF
      pharmacological treatments.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate N-terminal pro-BNP-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)
      plasmatic levels in heart failure patients with/without atrial fibrillation
      (AFib) and with/without diabetes (DM). METHODS: The study enrolled 120 patients
      with heart failure, age 71.26+/-9.14, 48.3% AFib and 30.8% with DM. The patients 
      were divided into 4 groups according to the presence or absence of AFib and DM:
      group 1, 46 patients in sinus rhythm (SR) without DM; group 2, 16 patients in SR 
      with DM; group 3, 37 patients with AFib and without DM; group 4, 21 patients with
      both AFib and DM. RESULTS: The patients in SR with DM displayed lower NT-proBNP
      levels than those with AFib without DM (1196.75+/-1183.11 vs 1940.59+/-963.665,
      p=0.02). We recorded no significant difference in comparison with the patients
      who had both AFib and DM (1196.75+/-1183.11 vs 1452.67+/-1257.94, p=NS). There
      was no significant difference between groups 3 and 4. Statistically significant
      correlations between ejection fraction, namely NYHA class and NT-proBNP levels
      were recorded only in the patients in SR-group 1 (r=-0.42, p<0.01) and group 2
      (r=-0.66, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between plasma NT-proBNP levels and 
      ejection fraction, namely NYHA class, were evinced only in patients in SR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with higher risk of atrial fibrillation (AF),
      but the impact of behavioral weight loss interventions on atrial fibrillation
      (AF) risk in persons with diabetes is unknown. We addressed this question in the 
      Look AHEAD randomized trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 5,067 overweight or 
      obese individuals 45 to 76 years old with type 2 diabetes without prevalent AF
      were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) designed to
      achieve and maintain weight loss through caloric reduction and increased physical
      activity or a diabetes support and education usual care group. Atrial
      fibrillation was ascertained from electrocardiograms at study examinations and
      hospitalization discharge summaries. Multivariable Cox models were used to
      estimate the intention-to-treat effect of the intervention adjusting for baseline
      covariates. During a mean follow-up of 9.0 years, 294 incident AF cases were
      identified. Rates of AF were comparable in the ILI and diabetes support and
      education groups (6.1 and 6.7 cases per 1,000 person-years, respectively, P =
      .42). The intervention did not affect AF incidence (multivariable hazard ratio
      [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.77-1.28). Similarly, neither weight loss nor improvement in
      physical fitness during the first year of the intervention was significantly
      associated with AF incidence: multivariable hazard ratio (95% CI) comparing top
      versus bottom quartile was 0.70 (0.41-1.18) for weight loss and 0.88 (0.55-1.43) 
      for physical fitness improvement. CONCLUSION: In a large randomized trial of
      overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, an ILI that induced modest
      weight loss did not reduce the risk of developing AF.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with diabetes and nonvalvular
      atrial fibrillation: the Rivaroxaban Once-daily, Oral, Direct Factor Xa
      Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and
      Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF Trial).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of both atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus
      (DM) are rising, and these conditions often occur together. Also, DM is an
      independent risk factor for stroke in patients with AF. We aimed to examine the
      safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban vs warfarin in patients with nonvalvular AF
      and DM in a prespecified secondary analysis of the ROCKET AF trial. METHODS: We
      stratified the ROCKET AF population by DM status, assessed associations with risk
      of outcomes by DM status and randomized treatment using Cox proportional hazards 
      models, and tested for interactions between randomized treatments. For efficacy, 
      primary outcomes were stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or non-central nervous
      system embolism. For safety, the primary outcome was major or nonmajor clinically
      relevant bleeding. RESULTS: The 5,695 patients with DM (40%) in ROCKET AF were
      younger, were more obese, and had more persistent AF, but fewer had previous
      stroke (the CHADS2 score includes DM and stroke). The relative efficacy of
      rivaroxaban and warfarin for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism was
      similar in patients with (1.74 vs 2.14/100 patient-years, hazard ratio [HR] 0.82)
      and without (2.12 vs 2.32/100 patient-years, HR 0.92) DM (interaction P = .53).
      The safety of rivaroxaban vs warfarin regarding major bleeding (HRs 1.00 and 1.12
      for patients with and without DM, respectively; interaction P = .43), major or
      nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding (HRs 0.98 and 1.09; interaction P = .17),
      and intracerebral hemorrhage (HRs 0.62 and 0.72; interaction P = .67) was
      independent of DM status. Adjusted exploratory analyses suggested 1.3-, 1.5-, and
      1.9-fold higher 2-year rates of stroke, vascular mortality, and myocardial
      infarction in DM patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The relative efficacy and
      safety of rivaroxaban vs warfarin was similar in patients with and without DM,
      supporting use of rivaroxaban as an alternative to warfarin in diabetic patients 
      with AF.

TI  - Risk of atrial fibrillation in diabetes mellitus: A nationwide cohort study.
PG  - 621-7
LID - 10.1177/2047487315599892 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Diabetes has been associated with atrial fibrillation but the current
      evidence is conflicting. In particular knowledge regarding young diabetes
      patients and the risk of developing atrial fibrillation is sparse. The aim of our
      study was to investigate the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with
      diabetes compared to the background population in Denmark. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Through Danish nationwide registries we included persons above 18 years of age
      and without prior atrial fibrillation and/or diabetes from 1996 to 2012. The
      study cohort was divided into a background population without diabetes and a
      diabetes group. The absolute risk of developing atrial fibrillation was
      calculated and Poisson regression models adjusted for sex, age and comorbidities 
      were used to calculate incidence rate ratios of atrial fibrillation. The total
      study cohort included 5,081,087 persons, 4,827,713 (95%) in the background
      population and 253,374 (5%) in the diabetes group. Incidence rates of atrial
      fibrillation per 1000 person years were stratified in four age groups from 18 to 
      39, 40 to 64, 65 to 74 and 75 to 100 years giving incidence rates (95% confidence
      intervals) of 0.02 (0.02-0.02), 0.99 (0.98-1.01), 8.89 (8.81-8.98) and 20.0
      (19.9-20.2) in the background population and 0.13 (0.09-0.20), 2.10 (2.00-2.20), 
      8.41 (8.10-8.74) and 20.1 (19.4-20.8) in the diabetes group, respectively. The
      adjusted incidence rate ratios in the diabetes group with the background
      population as reference were 2.34 (1.52-3.60), 1.52 (1.47-1.56), 1.20 (1.18-1.23)
      and 0.99 (0.97-1.01) in the four age groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Diabetes
      is an independent risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation/flutter, most
      pronounced in young diabetes patients. Routine screening for atrial
      fibrillation/flutter in diabetes patients might be beneficial and have
      therapeutic implications, especially in younger diabetes patients. TRANSLATIONAL 
      PERSPECTIVE: Diabetes increases the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and
      especially young diabetes patients have a high relative risk. Increased focus on 
      detecting atrial fibrillation in young diabetes patients might prove beneficial, 
      and both anticoagulation treatment and anti-arrhythmic treatment strategies
      should be considered as soon as possible.

AB  - AIMS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are worldwide public
      health challenges and major causes of death and cardiovascular events. The
      association between DM and AF is controversial in literature and data on outcomes
      of individuals with both diseases have not been evaluated in population studies. 
      We tested the hypothesis that DM is independently associated to AF
      hospitalization and assessed the risk of stroke and mortality in people with both
      conditions. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort-study of DM patients 
      and their corresponding controls identified in a administrative health database
      of the Lombardy Region. Both cohorts were followed for nine years. A
      multivariable Cox proportional-hazards-regression model was used to estimate the 
      hazard ratio (HR) for first hospitalization for AF and for clinical outcomes.
      RESULTS: Out of 9,061,258 residents, 285,428 (3.14%) DM subjects were identified,
      mean age 65.8+/-15 years, 49% were women. The cumulative incidence of AF in DM
      was 10.4% vs. 7.4% in non-DM. DM was a risk factor for AF (HR 1.32, 95% CI
      1.30-1.34; p<0.0001). Oral anticoagulants were prescribed in 34.8% of DM patients
      with AF. DM associated with AF, presented the highest HR for stroke: 2.63; 95% CI
      2.47-2.80 and for total death, HR 2.41; 95% CI 2.36-2.47. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      population study, DM was an independent risk factor for AF hospitalization. DM
      patients with AF had the highest risk of stroke and total mortality. Early
      identification of AF and a structured plan to optimize the comprehensive
      management of DM and AF patients is mandatory.

TI  - Hyperuricemia is associated with an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation
      in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 159-67
LID - 10.1007/s40618-015-0354-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hyperuricemia/gout and atrial fibrillation (AF) are two pathological
      conditions that are highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes and share multiple
      cardiovascular risk factors. However, the relationship between elevated levels of
      serum uric acid and risk of AF in type 2 diabetes is currently poorly known.
      METHODS: We studied a hospital-based sample of 842 (male/female = 463/379)
      patients with type 2 diabetes discharged from our Division of Endocrinology
      during 2007-2011. Hyperuricemia was defined as a serum uric acid level >7 mg/dl
      for men and >6 mg/dl for women or allopurinol use. The diagnosis of AF was
      confirmed in affected participants on the basis of ECGs and medical history by
      experienced cardiologists. RESULTS: Overall, 243 (28.9 %) patients had
      hyperuricemia and 91 (10.8 %) patients had persistent or permanent AF. Compared
      with those with normal serum uric acid levels, patients with hyperuricemia had a 
      remarkably greater prevalence of AF (20.6 vs. 7.1 %; p < 0.001). Hyperuricemia
      was significantly associated with an increased risk of prevalent AF (odds ratio
      3.41, 95 % CI 2.19-5.32; p < 0.001). Adjustments for age, sex, smoking,
      hemoglobin A1c, hypertension status, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease and previous histories of hyperthyroidism, ischemic heart
      disease and valvular heart diseases did not weaken this association
      (adjusted-odds ratio 6.27, 95 % CI 1.82-21.5; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These
      results indicate that hyperuricemia is associated with an increased prevalence of
      AF in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes, independently of multiple risk 
      factors and potential confounders.

TI  - Impact of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) on development of atrial fibrillation 
      in people with Type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1118-24
LID - 10.1111/dme.12856 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To examine if a simple biomarker can identify people with diabetes who are 
      at high risk of atrial fibrillation. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was
      conducted at a single centre in people with Type 2 diabetes referred to our
      department between January 2000 and December 2007. In 517 consecutive people
      without any history, signs or symptoms of atrial fibrillation at baseline, the
      association between baseline B-type natriuretic peptide level and future atrial
      fibrillation incidence was examined, with adjustments for other potentially
      confounding factors. RESULTS: A total of 28 people were diagnosed with new-onset 
      atrial fibrillation during a median 6-year follow-up. When people were
      categorized into three groups according to B-type natriuretic peptide clinical
      thresholds (20 and 100 pg/ml), hazard ratios for the development of atrial
      fibrillation in the middle and highest B-type natriuretic peptide groups were 2.8
      and 9.4, respectively, compared with the lowest B-type natriuretic peptide group.
      Time-dependent receiver-operating curve analysis identified a threshold for
      B-type natriuretic peptide to detect atrial fibrillation development of 52.8
      pg/ml (sensitivity 75.2%, specificity 68.8%). The B-type natriuretic peptide
      predictive value was independent of and similar to that of left atrial size and
      ventricular dimension. CONCLUSION: In people with Type 2 diabetes, high baseline 
      B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly associated with future
      atrial fibrillation development.

TI  - Duration of Diabetes Mellitus and Risk of Thromboembolism and Bleeding in Atrial 
      Fibrillation: Nationwide Cohort Study.
PG  - 2168-74
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.009371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Guidelines advocate anticoagulant treatment to all
      patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant diabetes mellitus. The
      potential refinement to thromboembolic risk stratification that may spring from
      subdividing diabetes mellitus is unexplored. The purpose was to investigate
      duration of diabetes mellitus as a predictor of thromboembolism and
      anticoagulant-related bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS:
      Using nationwide Danish registries, we identified all patients discharged from
      hospital with an incident diagnosis of atrial fibrillation from 2000 to 2011.
      Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for thromboembolism and bleeding
      according to years of diabetes mellitus duration in categories (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 
      and >/=15) and as a continuous variable using cubic splines were calculated by
      Cox regression. RESULTS: The study population comprised 137 222 patients with
      atrial fibrillation, of which 12.4% had diabetes mellitus. Compared with patients
      without diabetes mellitus and after adjustment for anticoagulant treatment and
      CHA2DS2-VASc components (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, previous
      stroke, vascular disease, and sex), the risk of thromboembolism was lowest in the
      0 to 4 years duration category (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval,
      1.03-1.20), and highest in the longest duration category of >/=15 years (hazard
      ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.70). When analyzed as a continuous
      variable, duration of diabetes mellitus was associated with risk of
      thromboembolism in a dose-response-dependent manner, but not with a higher risk
      of bleeding during anticoagulant treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrial 
      fibrillation, longer duration of diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher
      risk of thromboembolism, but not with a higher risk of anticoagulant-related
      bleeding. Considering the critical balance between preventing thromboembolism and
      avoiding bleeding, longer duration of diabetes mellitus may favor initiation of
      anticoagulant therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is frequent among patients with atrial
      fibrillation (AF). The RE-LY trial permits evaluation of patient characteristics,
      outcomes and the effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate among diabetic
      individuals. METHODS: Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between 
      diabetic and non-diabetic patients and the relative efficacy of each dose of
      dabigatran (150 mg bid and 110 mg bid) versus warfarin was evaluated. RESULTS: Of
      18,113 patients in RE-LY, 4221 patients (23.3%) had DM. Patients with DM were
      younger (70.9 vs. 71.7 years), more likely to have hypertension (86.6% vs.
      76.5%), coronary artery disease (37.4% vs. 24.9%) and peripheral vascular disease
      (5.6% vs. 3.2%); (all p<0.01). Time in therapeutic range for warfarin-treated
      patients was 65% for diabetic versus 68% for non-diabetic patients (p<0.001).
      Regardless of assigned treatment, stroke or systemic embolism was more common
      among patients with DM (1.9% per year vs. 1.3% per year, p<0.001). DM was also
      associated with an increased risk of death (5.1% per year vs. 3.5% per year,
      p<0.001) and major bleeding (4.2% per year vs. 3.0% per year, p<0.001). The
      absolute reduction in stroke or systemic embolism with dabigatran compared to
      warfarin was greater among patients with DM than those without DM (dabigatran 110
      mg: 0.59% per year vs. 0.05% per year; dabigatran 150 mg: 0.89% per year vs.
      0.51% per year). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to non-DM patients, AF patients with DM
      derive a greater absolute risk reduction in embolic events when treated with
      dabigatran. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00262600.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is more frequent in patients with
      diabetes than in the general population. However, characteristics contributing to
      AF risk in diabetes remain speculative. METHODS: Observational study of 83,162
      patients with type 2 diabetes, aged 30-79 years, with no baseline AF, 17% had
      history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 3.3% history of congestive heart
      failure (CHF), followed up for development of AF during mean 6.8 years from
      2005-2007 to 2012. A subgroup of 67,780 patients without history of CVD or CHF
      was also analysed. RESULTS: Using Cox regression, cardiovascular risk factors
      associated with risk for AF were updated mean BMI (HR 1.31 per 5 kg/m(2)) or
      obesity (HR 1.51), updated mean systolic BP (SBP; HR 1.13 per 10 mmHg) or
      hypertension (HR 1.71), and cumulative microalbuminuria (HR 1.21), p < 0.001 for 
      all analyses. Male sex, increasing age and height were also significant
      predictors. HRs were 1.76 for a history of CHF and 2.56 for in-study CHF, while
      1.32 for history of CVD and 1.38 for in-study CHD (p < 0.001). Among patients
      without history of CVD or CHF, significant predictors were similarly BMI, SBP,
      and cumulative microalbuminuria and CHF. The risk of AF differed in the subgroups
      achieving or not achieving a target BP < 140/85 mmHg. The HRs for AF were (per 10
      mmHg increase) 0.88 and 1.24, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The
      modifiable risk factors high BP, high BMI and albuminuria were strongly
      associated with AF in type 2 diabetes. CVD, advancing age and height were also
      associated with AF in type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Elevated glycated hemoglobin levels may increase the risk of atrial fibrillation 
      in patients with diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 3271-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the most common cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (AF) is
      always accompanied with various complications if without detection and treatment 
      timely. Blood-based pleiotropic molecule biomarkers have now been popularly
      applied in clinical detection. We hence performed this meta-analysis to evaluate 
      the correlation of serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels with the risk of AF
      in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: Covering myriads of
      computerized databases, we identified potential relevant studies for statistical 
      analysis. We used a standard reporting form to extract data from each included
      study. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) criteria was used for methodological quality 
      assessment. Statistical analyses were conducted with the STATA statistical
      software. RESULTS: Six cohort studies in full text fulfilled our inclusion
      criteria, and following overestimation indicated that serum levels of HbA1c in DM
      patients with AF was higher than that in DM patients without AF (SMD = 0.67, 95% 
      CI: 0.39-0.94, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses by sample size and detection method 
      implicated that elevated serum HbA1c levels exhibited significant correlations
      with an increased risk of AF in DM patients in the large-size subgroup (n >/=
      200), the small-size subgroup (n < 200), the high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) subgroup and the non-HPLC subgroup (Large-size: SMD = 0.70,
      95% CI: 0.38-1.03, P < 0.001; Small-size: SMD = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.09-1.19, P =
      0.023; HPLC: SMD = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.49-1.12, P < 0.001; Non-HPLC: SMD = 0.36, 95% 
      CI: 0.04-0.68, P = 0.029; respectively). CONCLUSION: Elevated serum HbA1c levels 
      may be associated with an increased risk of AF in DM patients, possibly
      reflecting that serum HbA1c level might be a potential biomarker in the
      prediction of AF in DM patients.

AB  - The global burden of atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is
      considerable, and prevalence rates are increasing. Diabetes is associated with an
      increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation; however, diabetes also
      influences the management and prognosis of atrial fibrillation. In the following 
      article, the authors describe the association between diabetes and atrial
      fibrillation; specifically, the significance of diabetes on the risk of atrial
      fibrillation, ischemic stroke and bleeding complications associated with
      anticoagulation. In addition, the authors evaluate the risks and outcomes of
      heart failure and the success rates of both ablation and cardioversion in atrial 
      fibrillation patients with diabetes. Finally, this article describes the
      association of HbA1c levels with the management and prognosis of atrial
      fibrillation patients.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic conditions and its
      prevalence has increased continuously over the past decades, primarily due to the
      obesity epidemic. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent sustained cardiac
      arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with increased cardiovascular
      and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shown that
      patients with diabetes have an increased risk of AF. However, the results about
      the relationship between diabetes and AF are still conflicting. Mechanisms that
      are responsible for an association between diabetes and AF, as well as the
      adequate treatment of AF in patients with diabetes, are still insufficiently
      studied. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of
      mechanisms that connect AF and diabetes, the clinical studies that include
      patients with both conditions, and the treatment options in modern pharmacology.

AB  - AIMS: We compared clinical outcomes in patients with AF with and without diabetes
      in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial
      Fibrillation trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: The main efficacy endpoints were SSE and
      mortality; safety endpoints were major and major/clinically relevant non-major
      bleeding. A total of 4547/18 201 (24.9%) patients had diabetes who were younger
      (69 vs. 70 years), more had coronary artery disease (39 vs. 31%), and higher mean
      CHADS2 (2.9 vs. 1.9) and HAS-BLED scores (1.9 vs. 1.7) (all P < 0.0001) than
      patients without diabetes. Patients with diabetes receiving apixaban had lower
      rates of SSE [hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.05),
      all-cause mortality (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67-1.02), cardiovascular mortality (HR
      0.89, 95% CI 0.66-1.20), intra-cranial haemorrhage (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.95),
      and a similar rate of myocardial infarction (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.62-1.67) compared 
      with warfarin. For major bleeding, a quantitative interaction was seen
      (P-interaction = 0.003) with a greater reduction in major bleeding in patients
      without diabetes even after multivariable adjustment. Other measures of bleeding 
      showed a consistent reduction with apixaban compared with warfarin without a
      significant interaction based on diabetes status. CONCLUSION: Apixaban has
      similar benefits on reducing stroke, decreasing mortality, and causing less
      intra-cranial bleeding than warfarin in patients with and without diabetes.

TI  - Ruptured giant mitral valve aneurysm: an unexpected finding in a diabetic patient
      with dyspnea and new-onset atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 506-10
AB  - Mitral valve aneurysm (MVA) is a rare valve disease. The case is reported of
      pathologically proven MVA in a 61-year-old diabetic male with chronic alcoholic
      liver disease who presented with dyspnea and new-onset atrial fibrillation,
      without clinical elements of current or recent infection. Transthoracic
      echocardiography revealed a 'cystic' formation of the anterior mitral leaflet
      (AML) with mild mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) hitting
      the AML. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed clearly that the formation
      on the AML was a valve aneurysm, and depicted the site of aneurysm rupture with
      an additional jet of MR through the rupture. Following mitral valve replacement, 
      pathology of the excised valve showed chronic bacterial endocarditis with
      calcified bacterial colonies, myxomatous changes with fibrinoid dissection of
      lamina fibrosa, and neovascularization of the leaflet. The mechanisms of MVA
      formation are discussed, together with its potential complications, diagnostic
      modalities and therapeutic strategies. The present case emphasizes that MVA is
      often a remnant of endocarditis, even when the latter is clinically silent and
      undiagnosed. The importance of chronic AR directed towards the AML as a
      predisposing condition for MVA formation is also underlined in this case. The
      superiority of TEE in providing a full exploration of the mitral valve morphology
      is verified.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) represents one of the most important risk factors for
      atrial fibrillation (AF) while AF is a strong and independent marker of overall
      mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in diabetic patients. Autonomic,
      electrical, electromechanical, and structural remodeling, including oxidative
      stress, connexin remodeling and glycemic fluctuations seem to be implicated in AF
      pathophysiology in the setting of DM. The present review highlights the
      association between DM and AF, provides a comprehensive overview of the
      responsible pathophysiological mechanisms and briefly discusses potential
      upstream therapies for DM-related atrial remodeling.

TI  - High risk factors of atrial fibrillation in type 2 diabetes: results from the
      Chinese Kailuan study.
PG  - 885-90
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcv051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological mechanisms for atrial fibrillation (AF)
      vulnerability in diabetic patients are largely unclear. AIM: To investigate the
      high risk factors of AF in Chinese Kailuan diabetes. DESIGN: A retrospective
      review of AF in Chinese Kailuan diabetes. METHODS: Research and statistic
      analysis on the clinical data of 9050 diabetic patients from Kailuan Coal Mine
      Group Corporation who participated in a health survey from July 2006 to October
      2007. RESULTS: Sixty diabetic patients (50 males and 10 females) were diagnosed
      with AF during the health checkup, with a prevalence of 0.66% (0.67% in males and
      0.62% in females). Univariate analysis showed that patients with AF were older
      and had higher levels of serum uric acid (UA), pulse pressure, serum c-reactive
      protein and anti-hypertensive medication usage, but lower levels of fasting blood
      glucose and triglycerides (TG). Multivariate analysis indicated that older age
      (OR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.06-1.12), increased UA (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.01) and
      decreased TG (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.55-0.92) were independent predictive factors
      of AF after adjusting for other variables. After gender stratification, age and
      UA remained as independent predictive factors of AF in both male and female
      patients. However, TG had an independent inverse association with AF in male
      patients only. CONCLUSIONS: Age and UA are independent predictive factors of AF
      in both male and female diabetic patients. TG is inversely correlated with AF in 
      male diabetic patients only.

TI  - Glycated hemoglobin and risk of first episode stroke in diabetic patients with
      atrial fibrillation: A cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients
      with atrial fibrillation. Whether glycemic control, evaluated by glycated
      hemoglobin, affects the risk of stroke in diabetic patients with atrial
      fibrillation remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between
      glycated hemoglobin and risk of first episode stroke in diabetic patients with
      atrial fibrillation. METHODS: By using the computerized database of the largest
      health maintenance organization in Israel, we identified a cohort of adults (age 
      >/=20 years) in whom atrial fibrillation was diagnosed before January 1, 2012.
      Eligible subjects had no previous stroke or transient ischemic attack and were
      not on anticoagulants at baseline. The cohort (37,358 subjects) was followed for 
      the first episode stroke or transient ischemic attack up to December 31, 2012.
      RESULTS: A total of 1052 subjects had stroke during 35,278 person-years of
      follow-up (stroke rate 2.98 per 100 person-years). Cox proportional hazards
      regression analysis adjusting for CHA2DS2-VASc score risk factors revealed that
      compared with subjects without diabetes, the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.04
      (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-1.30) for the lowest glycated hemoglobin
      quartile (<6.35%), 1.14 (95% CI 0.92-1.42) for the second quartile (6.35%-6.90%),
      1.46 (95% CI 1.19-1.79) for the third quartile (>6.90%-7.70%), and 1.63 (95% CI
      1.33-2.00) for the highest quartile(>7.70%) (for trend, P < .001). In diabetic
      patients (n = 11,176), the hazard ratio for stroke was 1.17 (95% CI 1.09-1.26)
      for every 1% increment in glycated hemoglobin level. The area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve was 0.585 for the CHA2DS2-VASc score, which
      increased to 0.604 when glycated hemoglobin was included in the model (P = .038).
      CONCLUSION: Glycated hemoglobin is directly associated with stroke risk, and it
      improves the predictive accuracy for stroke in diabetic patients with atrial
      fibrillation.

TI  - Body weight and risk of atrial fibrillation in 7,169 patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes; an observational study.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/s12933-014-0170-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity, type 2 diabetes and atrial fibrillation (AF) are closely
      associated, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We aimed to
      explore associations between body mass index (BMI) or weight change with risk of 
      AF in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 7,169 participations
      with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were stratified according to baseline BMI,
      and after a second BMI measurement within 18 months, further grouped according to
      relative weight change as "weight gain" (>1 BMI unit), "stable weight" (+/- 1 BMI
      unit) and "weight loss" (<1 BMI unit). The mean follow-up period was 4.6 years,
      and the risk of AF was estimated using adjusted Cox regression models. RESULTS:
      Average age at diabetes diagnosis was 60 years and the patients were slightly
      obese (mean BMI 30.2 kg/m(2)). During follow-up, 287 patients developed incident 
      AF, and those with overweight or obesity at baseline had 1.9-fold and 2.9-fold
      higher risk of AF, respectively, than those with normal BMI. The 14% of the
      patients with subsequent weight gain had 1.5-fold risk of AF compared with those 
      with stable weight or weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with newly diagnosed 
      type 2 diabetes, baseline overweight and obesity, as well as modest weight
      increase during the first 18 months after diagnosis, were associated with a
      substantially increased risk of incident AF. Patients with type 2 diabetes may
      benefit from efforts to prevent weight gain in order to reduce the risk of
      incident AF. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01121315.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and impact of diabetes mellitus on outcomes in patients 
      with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 62-71
LID - 10.3349/ymj.2015.56.1.62 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease, including atrial fibrillation (AF); however, the clinical
      characteristics and prognostic impact of DM in patients with nonvalvular AF have 
      not been well understood in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Included were 1644
      consecutive patients with nonvalvular AF. Endpoints included all-cause mortality,
      cardiovascular mortality, stroke, major bleeding, and combined endpoint events
      (CEE) during a 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: The prevalence of DM was 16.8% in
      nonvalvular AF patients. Compared with non-diabetic AF patients, diabetic AF
      patients were older and tended to coexist with other cardiovascular diseases.
      Most patients with DM (93.5%) were eligible for anticoagulation, as determined by
      CHADS2 scores. However, only 11.2% of patients received anticoagulation. During a
      1-year follow-up, the all-cause mortality and CEE rate in the DM group were
      significantly higher than those of the non-DM group, while the incidence of
      stroke was comparable. After multivariate adjustments, DM was still an
      independent risk factor for 1-year all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR)=1.558; 
      95% confidence interval (CI) 1.126-2.156; p=0.007], cardiovascular mortality
      (HR=1.615; 95% CI 1.052-2.479; p=0.028), and CEE (HR=1.523; 95% CI 1.098-2.112;
      p=0.012), yet not for stroke (HR=1.119; 95% CI 0.724-1.728; p=0.614). CONCLUSION:
      DM is a common morbidity coexisting with nonvalvular AF and is associated with an
      increased risk of 1-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and CEE. 
      However, no increased risk of stroke was found during a 1-year follow-up in
      patients with AF and DM.

TI  - The impact of associated diabetic retinopathy on stroke and severe bleeding risk 
      in diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation: the loire valley atrial
      fibrillation project.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is recognized as a stroke risk factor in atrial
      fibrillation (AF). Patients with diabetes with retinopathy have an increased risk
      for systemic cardiovascular complications, and severe diabetic retinopathy
      predisposes to ocular bleeding. We hypothesized that patients with diabetes,
      retinopathy, and AF have increased stroke/thromboembolism (TE) and severe
      bleeding risks when compared with patients with diabetes and AF who do not have
      retinopathy or to patients with AF and without diabetes. METHODS: We tested our
      hypothesis in a large "real-world" cohort of individuals with AF from the Loire
      Valley Atrial Fibrillation project. RESULTS: Of 8,962 patients with AF in our
      dataset, 1,409 (16%) had documented diabetes mellitus. Of these, 163 (1.8% of the
      whole cohort) were patients with diabetic retinopathy. After a follow-up of 31
      +/- 36 months, when compared with patients without diabetes, the risk of
      stroke/TE in patients with diabetes with no retinopathy increased 1.3-fold
      (relative risk [RR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.59; P = .01); in patients with diabetes
      with retinopathy, the risk of stroke/TE was increased 1.58-fold (RR, 1.58; 95%
      CI, 1.07-2.32; P = .02). There was no significant difference when patients with
      diabetes with no retinopathy were compared with patients with diabetes with
      retinopathy (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.80-1.84; P = .37). A similar pattern was seen
      for mortality and severe bleeding. On multivariate analysis, the presence of
      diabetic retinopathy did not emerge as an independent predictor for stroke/TE or 
      severe bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Crude rates of stroke/TE increased in a stepwise
      fashion when patients without diabetes and with AF were compared with patients
      with diabetes with no retinopathy and patients with diabetes with retinopathy.
      However, we have shown for the first time, to our knowledge, that the presence of
      diabetic retinopathy did not emerge as an independent predictor for stroke/TE or 
      severe bleeding on multivariate analysis.

TI  - HbA1c levels as predictors of ablation outcome in type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 130-6
LID - 10.1007/s00059-014-4154-6 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the levels of HbA1c could
      predict the outcome of ablation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study
      comprised 149 consecutive patients with T2DM and PAF who underwent their first
      circumferential pulmonary vein isolation. HbA1c levels were measured before
      ablation. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to assess the
      relationship between HbA1c levels and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF).
      RESULTS: Of the 149 patients, 60 (40.3 %) developed AF recurrence after a median 
      12-month follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that left
      atrium size and HbA1c were independent predictors of recurrent atrial
      tachyarrhythmia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that an 
      HbA1c cut-off value of >/= 6.9 % predicted recurrence with 55.0 % sensitivity and
      67.4 % specificity (AUC = 0.634). The success rate of ablation was 69.0 % in
      patients with an HbA1c value of < 6.9 % compared with 46.8 % in those with an
      HbA1c value of >/= 6.9 % (log-rank test, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: High levels of
      HbA1c were associated with an increased risk of recurrence of atrial
      tachyarrhythmia in patients with T2DM and PAF undergoing catheter ablation.

TI  - Beneficial effects of pioglitazone on retardation of persistent atrial
      fibrillation progression in diabetes mellitus patients.
PG  - 499-505
AB  - This study aimed to explore the effects of pioglitazone treatment on progression 
      from persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) to permanent atrial fibrillation in
      diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and to investigate the possible mechanisms
      involved in those effects.A total of 146 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with
      firstly identified persistent AF were selected. Seventy patients were randomized 
      into the pioglitazone (30 mg/day) group and 76 into the placebo group.
      Pro-collagen type I carboxyterminal peptide (PICP), advanced glycation end
      products (AGEs), and angiotensin II were assayed and left atrial diameter (LA
      diameter) was measured at the first presence of persistent AF, and at 6 and 14
      months of follow-up. The time point of identification of permanent AF and the
      incidence of permanent AF in the patients were all recorded.Thirty-seven (49%) of
      the 76 patients in the placebo group and 21 (30%) of the 70 patients in the
      pioglitazone group progressed to permanent AF (P = 0.028). No significant
      differences existed in the follow-up time (20.5 +/- 3.97 months for pioglitazone 
      group versus 20.9 +/- 4.14 months for placebo group) between the two groups (P = 
      0.535). In the pioglitazone group, no significant change was found in angiotensin
      II level. The PICP level did not change significantly at 6-months of follow-up,
      but decreased significantly at 14-months of follow-up (P = 0.032). The AGE (P =
      0.037 at 6-month follow-up, P < 0.035 at 14-month follow-up) level was
      significantly lower at both 6 and 14-months of followup.By lowering the PICP
      level, pioglitazone treatment may decrease the incidence of permanent AF in DM
      patients with persistent AF, which may be associated with the suppressing effect 
      of pioglitazone on AGEs.

TI  - Diabetes and atrial fibrillation: stratification and prevention of stroke risks.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/1878-5085-5-17 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although evidence is not very clear, diabetes is assumed to be an
      independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). One reason for the lack of 
      evidence could be that AF often is not detected due to its paroxysmal or
      asymptomatic character. A better understanding of the relationship between both
      diseases and improved detection of AF is necessary since the combination of both 
      diseases dramatically increase the risk of strokes if not treated properly.
      METHODS: Available literature about diabetes as an independent risk factor for AF
      has been evaluated, and limitations of studies are discussed. RESULTS: Results
      from different trials and registers are contradictory concerning diabetes as an
      independent risk factor for AF. Reasons for these differences can be found in
      different study designs and neglecting patients with unknown AF. CONCLUSIONS: Due
      to the increasing burden of disease of diabetes and AF as common risk factors for
      stroke, a systematic screening for AF in diabetes patients could provide a better
      understanding of their correlation and personalized prevention strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between
      asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) and abnormalities of the
      autonomic nervous system in type 2 diabetic patients who did not have evidence of
      atrial fibrillation at baseline. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a multicentric
      cross-sectional controlled study, 1992 patients with type 2 diabetes were
      screened. All underwent ambulatory ECG recording for 48-hour at 3, 6, 9, and
      12months. Heart rate variability (HRV) was used as indicator of autonomic
      activity. One hundred seventy-six diabetics with silent atrial fibrillation
      episodes (SAFE group) and 288 without silent atrial fibrillation (non-SAFE group)
      were enrolled. These selected diabetics were matched on clinical and
      anthropometric data to 120 control subjects without diabetes of the control
      group. HRV analysis evidenced that LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in the
      SAFE group than in the non-SAFE group (P<0.05) in the whole period of HM
      analysis. AF absolute burdens were positively correlated with LF/HF ratio
      (r=0.31, P<0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that LF/HF ratio was an
      independent determinant of AF episodes. CONCLUSIONS: This study originally showed
      a strong relationship between autonomic dysfunction and silent atrial
      fibrillation in type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (DM) and is associated with markers of poor glycemic control; however, the impact
      of glycemic control on incident AF and outcomes is unknown. The aims of this
      study were to prospectively evaluate if intensive glycemic control in patients
      with DM affects incident AF and to evaluate morbidity and mortality in patients
      with DM and incident AF. A total of 10,082 patients with DM from the Action to
      Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) cohort were studied in a
      randomized, double-blind fashion. Participants were randomized to an intensive
      therapeutic strategy targeting a glycated hemoglobin level of <6.0% or a standard
      strategy targeting a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0% to 7.9%. Incident AF
      occurred in 159 patients (1.58%) over the follow-up period, at a rate of 5.9 per 
      1,000 patient-years in the intensive-therapy group and a rate of 6.37 per 1,000
      patient-years in the standard-therapy group (p = 0.52). In a multivariate model, 
      predictors of incident AF were age, weight, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate,
      and heart failure history. Patients with DM and new-onset AF had a hazard ratio
      of 2.65 for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 3.86, p <0.0001),
      a hazard ratio of 2.1 for myocardial infarction (95% confidence interval 1.33 to 
      3.31, p = 0.0015), and a hazard ratio of 3.80 for the development of heart
      failure (95% confidence interval 2.48 to 5.84, p <0.0001). In conclusion,
      intensive glycemic control did not affect the rate of new-onset AF. Patients with
      DM and incident AF had an increased risk for morbidity and mortality compared
      with those without AF.

TI  - Association of metformin with lower atrial fibrillation risk among patients with 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus: a population-based dynamic cohort and in vitro studies.
PG  - 123
LID - 10.1186/s12933-014-0123-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), an inflammatory process involving
      arrhythmia, is associated with severe morbidity and mortality and commonly seen
      in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). The effect of metformin, the most
      commonly used medication for patients with DM, on AF has not been investigated.
      The primary aim of this study was to examine whether metformin prevented the
      occurrence of AF in type 2 DM patients by analyzing a nationwide,
      population-based dynamic cohort. Additionally, we investigated the effect of
      metformin on tachycardia-induced myolysis and oxidative stress in atrial cells.
      METHODS: The study population included 645,710 patients with type 2 diabetes and 
      not using other anti-diabetic medication from a subset of the Taiwan National
      Health Insurance Research Database. Of these patients, those who used metformin
      were categorized as the user group, and the remaining were classified as the
      non-user group. The time-dependent Cox's proportional hazard model was used to
      examine the effect of metformin on AF and the status of metformin use was treated
      as a time-dependent covariate. HL-1 atrial cells were paced with or without
      metformin, and then troponin and heavy-chain-myosin were measured as markers of
      myolysis. RESULTS: After 13 years of follow-up, 9,983 patients developed AF with 
      an incidence rate of 1.5% (287 per 100,000 person-years). After adjusting for
      co-morbidities and medications, metformin independently protected the diabetic
      patients from new-onset AF with a hazard ratio of .81 (95% confidence interval
      0.76-0.86, p < 0.0001). Metformin significantly decreased the extent of
      pacing-induced myolysis and the production of reactive oxygen species.
      CONCLUSION: Metformin use was associated with a decreased risk of AF in patients 
      with type 2 DM who were not using other anti-diabetic medication, probably via
      attenuation of atrial cell tachycardia-induced myolysis and oxidative stress.

      rats.
PG  - 5-14
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvu176 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We investigated whether glucose fluctuations aggravate cardiac fibrosis and
      increase the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in rats with diabetes
      mellitus (DM). METHODS AND RESULTS: Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were
      randomly divided into three groups: uncontrolled DM (U-STZ) group, controlled DM 
      (C-STZ) group, and DM with glucose fluctuations (STZ-GF) group. Glucose
      fluctuations were induced by fasting for 24 h and additional regular insulin
      injections (0.5 IU/kg) administered three times per week for three consecutive
      weeks. C-STZ rats were administered long acting insulin (20 IU/kg) twice a day to
      control blood glucose levels. Cardiac fibrosis evaluated by Masson trichrome
      staining and the expressions of collagen type 1, collagen type 3, and
      alpha-smooth muscle actin were increased in U-STZ rats compared with C-STZ rats, 
      which were more pronounced in STZ-GF rats. The inducibility of AF was
      significantly larger in U-STZ rats than C-STZ rats and was greatest in STZ-GF
      rats. To explore the mechanism of cardiac fibrosis, we investigated the levels of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis. The expression of malondialdehyde,
      an indicator of ROS levels, was significantly upregulated in STZ-GF rats compared
      with U-STZ rats, along with increased thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip)
      expression in STZ-GF rats. Furthermore, caspase-3 expression and the number of
      TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased in STZ-GF rats compared with
      U-STZ and C-STZ rats. CONCLUSION: Glucose fluctuations increase the incidence of 
      AF by promoting cardiac fibrosis. Increased ROS levels caused by upregulation of 
      Txnip expression may be a mechanism whereby in glucose fluctuations induce
      fibrosis.

TI  - Rosiglitazone attenuates atrial structural remodeling and atrial fibrillation
      promotion in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits.
PG  - 178-83
LID - 10.1111/1755-5922.12079 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The pleiotropic effects of glitazones may favorably affect atrial
      remodeling. We sought to investigate the effects of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) activator rosiglitazone on
      atrial structural remodeling and atrial fibrillation (AF) promotion in
      alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. METHODS: Twenty alloxan-induced diabetic
      rabbits were randomly divided into two groups (10 animals in each group), namely 
      the diabetic rosiglitazone group (treated with rosiglitazone 2 mg/day/kg for 4
      weeks) and the nontreated diabetic group, while 10 additional healthy rabbits
      served as controls. Moreover, isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were
      used to evaluate atrial electrophysiological parameters and vulnerability to AF, 
      examined by burst pacing. Histological examination was also performed, whereas
      plasma oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers were measured. RESULTS: The
      duration of induced AF was significantly prolonged in the alloxan-induced
      diabetic rabbits compared with controls (1.6 +/- 0.4 s vs. 0 s; P < 0.05).
      Rosiglitazone treatment significantly reduced the duration of induced AF in the
      treated rabbits (1.6 +/- 0.4 s vs. 1.2 +/- 0.05 s; P < 0.05). Moreover,
      rosiglitazone attenuated atrial structural remodeling reducing the interatrial
      activation time (35.4 +/- 12.1 ms vs. 24.2 +/- 10.8 ms, P < 0.05; control 23.3
      +/- 10.4 ms) and the atrial interstitial fibrosis as well (collagen volume
      fraction: 5.6 +/- 3.9% vs. 2.4 +/- 2.1%, P < 0.05; control 1.6 +/- 0.8%).
      Rosiglitazone increased plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and, on the
      other hand, decreased malondialdehyde (MDA), hs-C-reactive protein, and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha levels. CONCLUSION: Rosiglitazone attenuates arrhythmogenic
      atrial structural remodeling and AF promotion in alloxan-induced diabetic
      rabbits. Also, it seems to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation in this
      experimental model.

AB  - The relationship between atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus type 2 is
      controversial, and various studies have demonstrated conflicting results.
      However, the majority of larger prospective studies published during recent years
      demonstrated a positive correlation. After multivariate adjustment diabetes
      increased the risk for atrial fibrillation at least two fold. This combination is
      associated with substantially increased risks of death and cardiovascular events 
      (stroke and heart failure). Atrial fibrillation in patients with diabetes
      mellitus type 2 identifies individuals who are likely to obtain greater benefits 
      from glycemic control and anticoagulants as well as antihypertensive therapy.

LID - 10.1586/14779072.2014.882230 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events 
      independently of other factors such as age, sex, BMI and blood pressure. Diabetes
      plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation because it
      causes alterations to the autonomic nervous system. It may also be associated
      with an increased prevalence of asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation,
      which cause cerebrovascular disease more often than chronic atrial fibrillation. 
      The presence of silent cerebral ischemia doubles the risk of stroke in the
      general population independently of other cardiovascular risk factors; therefore,
      early detection of these episodes is important to determine preventive measures
      against the first cerebrovascular disease.

TI  - Can preoperative serum level of creatinine predict new-onset atrial fibrillation 
      in non-diabetic male patients undergoing open heart surgery? A retrograde view.
PG  - 861-3
AB  - Renal dysfunction is a risk marker in patients who candidate for coronary artery 
      bypass graft (CABG). Renal disorder is associated with prolonged stays in
      intensive care unit and hospital, morbidity and mortality. Aim of this study is
      specific evaluation of association between preoperative creatinine (Cr) with
      atrial fibrillation (AF) after elective off-pump CABG in non-diabetic male
      patients with normal ejection fraction. Two hundred non-diabetic male patients
      with normal ejection fraction undergoing elective off pump CABG surgery enrolled 
      in this cross-sectional study and were stratified by present or absence of
      postoperative atrial fibrillation: patients with postoperative new-onset atrial
      fibrillation (n=100) as group 1 and patients without new-onset postoperative
      atrial fibrillation as group 2 (n=100). Preoperative serological test of the
      participants, such as serum creatinine, were recorded in their medical dossiers. 
      Data were analyzed in SPSS-16 software and tested for association between atrial 
      fibrillation with creatinine level by using student t test, chi-square test or
      logistic regression. Cr level in patients with and without AF three days before
      surgery were 1.8+/-0.3 and 1.0+/-0.4 respectively (P value for Cr=0.00). On
      surgical day, mean Cr level in patients with and without AF were 1.6+/-0.2 and
      1.1+/-0.5 respectively (P value for Cr = 0.00). Of the 100, male patients with
      postoperative AF, duration and frequency of recurrence of AF were not associated 
      with Cr at three days before surgery and on surgical days (P>0.05). Patients with
      postoperative AF had unsuitable status of renal function compare to patients
      without AF; however, preoperative serum creatinine cannot associate with duration
      and frequency of recurrence of AF.

TI  - Effects of prescribed antithrombotics and other cardiovascular pharmacotherapies 
      on all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes and atrial fibrillation - a
      cohort study from Sweden using propensity score analyses.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/1758-5996-6-2 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To study mortality rates among patients with diabetes and concomitant
      atrial fibrillation (AF), prescribed different cardiovascular drugs in primary
      health care. METHODS: Study population consisted of men (n = 1319) and women (n =
      1094) aged >/=45 years from a database including 75 primary care centres in
      Sweden. Cox regression analysis, with hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence
      interval (95% CIs) and mortality (years to death) as outcome, and Laplace
      regression, with difference in time to first 10% mortality (with 95% CI), were
      performed. Independent variables were prescribed cardiovascular drugs. Regression
      models were adjusted for a propensity score calculated separately for each
      prescribed drug class (comprising age, cardiovascular co-morbidities, education, 
      marital status and pharmacotherapy). RESULTS: Overall mortality was lower in the 
      whole sample for anticoagulants vs no treatment (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.26-0.77); and 
      among patients < 80 years for anticoagulants vs. antiplatelets (HR 0.44; 95% CI
      0.25-0.78); while among individuals aged >/=80 years, antiplatelets (HR 0.47; 95%
      CI 0.26-0.87) and anticoagulants (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.24-1.00) vs. no treatment
      were equally effective. Statins were associated with lower mortality among those 
      <80 years (HR 0.45; 95% CI 0.29-0.71). Laplace regression models in the whole
      sample, with years to first 10% of total mortality as outcome, were significant
      for: among patients < 80 years anticoagulants vs. no treatment 2.70 years (95% CI
      0.04-5.37), anticoagulants vs. antiplatelets 2.31 years (95% CI 0.84-3.79), and
      those >/=80 antiplatelets vs. no treatment 1.78 years (95% CI 1.04-2.52).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that antiplatelets could exert a beneficial
      effect among those above 80 years.

AB  - Diabetic patients have higher risk of stroke when compared to non-diabetics and
      in 25% of patients the cause of stroke is unknown. Marfella et al hypothesized
      that subclinical episodes of atrial fibrillation may be a common etiologic
      factor. 464 type-2 diabetic patients were compared to 240 health controls and
      were followed-up for 37 months. Silent cerebral infarcts at baseline were more
      common among diabetic patients with silent AF (176 patients) when compared to
      non-silent AF group (288 patients) (61% vs. 29%; p < 0.001) and was associated
      with higher number of stroke at follow-up.

PG  - 869

AB  - Body mass index (BMI) is a powerful predictor of death, type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
      and cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Over the last few decades, we
      have witnessed a global rise in adult obesity of epidemic proportions. Similarly,
      there has been a parallel increase in the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), 
      itself a significant cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This may be
      partly attributable to advances in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) 
      and heart failure (HF) improving life expectancy, however, epidemiological
      studies have demonstrated an independent association between obesity, diabetes
      and AF, suggesting possible common pathophysiological mechanisms and risk
      factors. Indeed, cardiac remodeling, haemodynamic alterations, autonomic
      dysfunction, and diastolic dysfunction have been reported in obese and diabetic
      cohorts. Moreover, diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by an adverse
      structural and functional cardiac phenotype, which may predispose to the
      development of AF. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological and
      mechanistic relationships between obesity, diabetes and AF, and some of the
      challenges posed in the management of this high-risk group of individuals.

AB  - The primary objective of the S.AGES cohort is to describe the real-life
      therapeutic care of elderly patients. Patients and methods. This is a prospective
      observational cohort study of 3 700 non-institutionalized patients over the age
      of 65 years with either type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic pain or atrial
      fibrillation (AF) recruited by French general practitioners (GPs). Follow-up is
      planned for 3 years. Baseline characteristics. In the chronic pain sub-cohort,
      33% of patients are treated with only grade 1 analgesics, 29% with grade 2
      analgesics and 3% with grade 3 analgesics, and 22% have no pain treatment. In the
      T2DM sub-cohort, 61% of patients have well-controlled diabetes (Hb1c<7%) and 18% 
      are treated with insulin. In the AF sub-cohort, 65% of patients have a CHADS2
      score greater than 2, 77% are treated with oral anticoagulants, 17% with platelet
      inhibitors, 40% with antiarrhythmic drugs and 56% with rate slowing medications. 
      Conclusion. The S.AGES cohort presents a unique opportunity to clarify the
      real-life therapeutic management of ambulatory elderly subjects and will help to 
      identify the factors associated with the occurrence of major clinical events.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated whether subclinical episodes of atrial
      fibrillation (AF) were associated with an increased risk of silent cerebral
      infarct (SCI) and stroke in diabetic patients younger than 60 years who did not
      have other clinical evidence of AF and cerebrovascular disease at baseline.
      BACKGROUND: In type 2 diabetic patients, one-fourth of strokes are of unknown
      cause, and subclinical episodes of AF may be a common etiologic factor. METHODS: 
      A total of 464 type 2 diabetic patients younger than 60 years were included in a 
      longitudinal observational study and matched to patients without diabetes.
      Patients underwent 48-h electrocardiographic Holter monitoring quarterly to
      detect brief subclinical episodes of AF (duration of AF <48 h) and were followed 
      up for 37 months. The outcomes were SCI, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging
      of the brain, and stroke events during the follow-up period. RESULTS: The
      prevalence of subclinical episodes of AF was significantly greater among patients
      with diabetes compared with matched healthy subjects (11% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.0001). 
      During an average duration of 37 months, 43 stroke events occurred in the
      diabetic population and no events occurred in healthy subjects. Diabetic patients
      with silent episodes of AF (n = 176) had a higher baseline prevalence of SCI (61%
      vs. 29%; p < 0.01) and a higher number of stroke events (17.3% vs. 5.9%; p <
      0.01) during the follow-up period than the other patients (n = 288). An episode
      of silent AF was an independent determinant of SCI (odds ratio: 4.441; p < 0.001;
      confidence interval: 2.42 to 8.16) and an independent predictor of the occurrence
      of stroke in diabetic patients (hazard ratio: 4.6; p < 0.01; confidence interval:
      2.7 to 9.1). CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical episodes of AF occurred frequently in type 
      2 diabetic patients and were associated with a significantly increased risk of
      SCI and stroke.

AB  - The association between serum uric acid (SUA) levels and atrial fibrillation (AF)
      is currently poorly known. We examined the association between SUA levels and
      risk of incident AF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We followed for 10
      years a random sample of 400 type 2 diabetic outpatients, who were free from AF
      at baseline. A standard 12-lead electrocardiography was undertaken annually and a
      diagnosis of incident AF was confirmed in affected participants by a single
      cardiologist. Over 10 years, there were 42 incident AF cases (cumulative
      incidence of 10.5%). Elevated SUA level was associated with an increased risk of 
      incident AF (odds ratio 2.43, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 3.4, p <0.0001 for
      each 1-SD increase in SUA level). Adjustments for age, gender, body mass index,
      hypertension, chronic kidney disease, electrocardiographic features (left
      ventricular hypertrophy and PR interval), and use of diuretics and allopurinol
      did not attenuate the association between SUA and incident AF (adjusted odds
      ratio 2.44, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 3.9, p <0.0001). Further adjustment
      for variables that were included in the 10-year Framingham Heart Study-derived AF
      risk score did not appreciably weaken this association. Results remained
      unchanged even when SUA was modeled as a categorical variable (stratifying by
      either SUA median or hyperuricemia), and when patients with previous coronary
      heart disease or heart failure were excluded from analysis. In conclusion, our
      findings suggest that elevated SUA levels are strongly associated with an
      increased incidence of AF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus even after
      adjustment for multiple clinical risk factors for AF.

TI  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with an increased prevalence of
      atrial fibrillation in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 301-9
LID - 10.1042/CS20130036 [doi]
AB  - NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and AF (atrial fibrillation) are two
      pathological conditions that are highly prevalent in developed countries and
      share multiple risk factors. The relationship between NAFLD and AF in Type 2
      diabetes is currently unknown. We studied a hospital-based sample of 702 patients
      with Type 2 diabetes discharged from our Division of Endocrinology during
      2007-2011. The diagnosis of AF was confirmed in affected participants on the
      basis of ECGs and medical history by experienced cardiologists. NAFLD was defined
      by ultrasonographic detection of hepatic steatosis in the absence of other liver 
      diseases. Of the 702 hospitalized patients included in the study, 514 (73.2%) of 
      them had NAFLD and 85 (12.1%) had persistent or permanent AF. NAFLD was
      associated with an increased risk of prevalent AF {OR (odds ratio), 3.04 [95% CI 
      (confidence interval), 1.54-6.02]; P<0.001}. Adjustments for age, sex, systolic
      BP (blood pressure), HbA1c, (glycated haemoglobin), estimated GFR (glomerular
      filtration rate), total cholesterol, electrocardiographic LVH (left ventricular
      hypertrophy), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and prior history of 
      HF (heart failure), VHD (valvular heart disease) or hyperthyroidism did not
      attenuate the association between NAFLD and AF [adjusted OR, 5.88 (95% CI,
      2.72-12.7); P<0.001]. In conclusion, our results show that ultrasound-diagnosed
      NAFLD is strongly associated with an increased prevalence of persistent or
      permanent AF in patients with Type 2 diabetes, independently of several clinical 
      risk factors for AF. The potential impact of NAFLD on AF deserves particular
      attention, especially with respect to the implications for screening and
      surveillance strategies in the growing number of patients with NAFLD.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most important risk factors for atrial
      fibrillation (AF) and is a predictor of stroke and thromboembolism. DM may
      increase the incidence of AF, and when it is combined with other risk factors,
      the incidence of stroke and thromboembolism may also be higher; furthermore,
      hospitalization due to heart failure appears to increase. Maintenance of
      well-controlled blood glucose and low levels of HbA1c in accordance with
      guidelines may decrease the incidence of AF. The mechanisms of AF associated with
      DM are autonomic remodeling, electrical remodeling, structural remodeling, and
      insulin resistance. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is suggested to be
      an upstream therapy for this type of AF. Studies have indicated that catheter
      ablation may be effective for AF associated with DM, restoring sinus rhythm and
      improving prognosis. Catheter ablation combined with hypoglycemic agents may
      further increase the rate of maintenance of sinus rhythm and reduce the need for 
      reablation.

LID - 10.5603/CJ.2013.0010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor for atrial
      fibrillation (AF). However, the underlying mechanisms are still not clearly
      elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the atrial electromechanical
      function, atrial electrophysiological changes and AF inducibility in
      alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. METHODS: In 8 alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits 
      and 8 controls, we evaluated atrial electromechanical function by tissue Doppler 
      imaging. Isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were prepared to measure
      atrial refractory effective period (AERP) and its dispersion (AERPD), interatrial
      conduction time (IACT) and vulnerability to AF. Atrial interstitial fibrosis was 
      evaluated by Sirius-Red staining. RESULTS: Compared with controls, left atrial
      lateral wall Pa'-start interval (Pastart) and right atrial wall Pastart were
      increased in diabetic rabbits. AERPD was increased and IACT was prolonged in
      diabetic rabbits. Inducibility of AF in diabetic group was significant higher
      than controls (6/8 vs. 1/8, p < 0.05). Extensive interstitial fibrosis was
      observed in the DM group (p < 0.01). Correlation analysis showed that right
      atrial wall Pastart, Pa'-peak interval (Papeak) and total electromechanical
      activity (TEMA); left atrial lateral wall Papeak and TEMA, left atrial posterior 
      wall TEMA, and IACT were correlated with atrial areas of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS:
      Atrial electromechanical function is impaired in diabetic rabbits, and is
      associated with atrial fibrosis and interatrial electrical conduction delay.

      atrial fibrillation in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - e57183
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0057183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
      and atrial fibrillation (AF) in type 2 diabetes is currently unknown. We examined
      the relationship between NAFLD and risk of incident AF in people with type 2
      diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively followed for 10 years a random
      sample of 400 patients with type 2 diabetes, who were free from AF at baseline. A
      standard 12-lead electrocardiogram was undertaken annually and a diagnosis of
      incident AF was confirmed in affected participants by a single cardiologist. At
      baseline, NAFLD was defined by ultrasonographic detection of hepatic steatosis in
      the absence of other liver diseases. During the 10 years of follow-up, there were
      42 (10.5%) incident AF cases. NAFLD was associated with an increased risk of
      incident AF (odds ratio [OR] 4.49, 95% CI 1.6-12.9, p<0.005). Adjustments for
      age, sex, hypertension and electrocardiographic features (left ventricular
      hypertrophy and PR interval) did not attenuate the association between NAFLD and 
      incident AF (adjusted-OR 6.38, 95% CI 1.7-24.2, p = 0.005). Further adjustment
      for variables that were included in the 10-year Framingham Heart Study-derived AF
      risk score did not appreciably weaken this association. Other independent
      predictors of AF were older age, longer PR interval and left ventricular
      hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD is
      strongly associated with an increased incidence of AF in patients with type 2
      diabetes even after adjustment for important clinical risk factors for AF.

AB  - Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is a possible link between abnormal metabolism in
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart
      failure (HF). The aim of this study was to elucidate the association between
      attenuated heart rate recovery (HRR) and these manifestations of myocardial
      dysfunction in T2DM. Nine hundred fourteen consecutive patients with T2DM (mean
      age 56 +/- 11 years, 508 men) without diabetes mellitus complications, with
      negative results on stress echocardiography, were enrolled. Patients with known
      cardiac disease were excluded. Demographics, clinical assessment, co-morbidities,
      and insulin use were collected prospectively. The association of HRR with
      new-onset HF and AF was sought using a Cox proportional-hazards model. There were
      47 events (22 HF and 25 AF) during a median follow-up period of 7.8 years. Events
      were associated with age, exercise capacity, HRR, and left atrial volume index
      but not with baseline glycosylated hemoglobin, left ventricular mass index, or
      standard markers of diastolic function. In sequential Cox models for the combined
      outcomes, the model based on clinical data (age and gender; overall chi-square = 
      5.5) was not significantly improved by left atrial volume index (chi-square =
      8.6, p = 0.10) or maximum METs (chi-square = 8.7, p = 0.07) but was significantly
      improved by adding HRR (chi-square = 19.7, p = 0.004). In addition, HRR provided 
      significant incremental prognostic value regarding the composite end point (net
      reclassification improvement 19.2%, p = 0.04; integrated discrimination
      improvement 1.58%, p = 0.004). In conclusion, the association of HRR with
      subsequent HF and AF, independent of and incremental to left atrial volume index 
      and other markers of abnormal cardiac structure and function, indicates a role
      for autonomic neuropathy as the link between metabolic and cardiac risk in
      patients with T2DM.

TI  - New oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: impact of
      gender, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1471-80
LID - 10.1586/erc.12.148 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of new oral anticoagulants is a major development in cardiovascular
      medicine. In this overview, we sought to evaluate the impact of gender, heart
      failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes on stroke prevention
      with warfarin and the new oral anticoagulants by conducting a semisystematic
      review and meta-analysis including 44,563 patients in recent contemporary Phase
      III trials. The new oral anticoagulants were superior to warfarin irrespective of
      gender or the presence of diabetes. For nonparoxysmal AF, event rates are similar
      with warfarin and new anticoagulants. There is some suggestion of the benefit of 
      new oral anticoagulants in patients with paroxysmal AF. For patients without
      heart failure, the new drugs are superior, whereas in patients with evidence of
      heart failure the new drugs were similar to warfarin. In conclusion, new oral
      anticoagulants are better than warfarin irrespective of gender or the presence of
      diabetes mellitus. Patients with heart failure and nonparoxysmal AF seem not to
      gain additional prognostic benefit from new anticoagulants.

AB  - Platelet abnormalities in diabetes mellitus (DM) and atrial fibrillation (AF) may
      underline the etiology of a prothrombotic state in these conditions. Increased
      mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker of abnormal platelet function and
      activation. We aimed to investigate the possible association of chronic AF with
      MPV in patients who have type 2 DM. Patients who had type 2 DM with either
      chronic (>/=6 months) AF or normal sinus rhythm (NSR) were included in the study.
      A total of 162 patients (aged 38-89 years) were divided into 2 groups according
      to the presence of either AF or NSR. Group 1 consisted of 81 diabetic patients
      with AF, and group 2 consisted of 81 diabetic patients with NSR. The two groups
      were not significantly different in terms of age, and gender, as well as in
      hypertension, smoking, history of coronary artery disease, previous
      cerebrovascular accidents, microalbuminuria, retinopathy, duration of DM, body
      mass index, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride (p > 0.05 for
      all variables). Although no significant difference was present between groups
      concerning platelet count; for patients with AF, MPV was higher compared with
      patients with NSR (9.0 +/- 0.2 fl vs. 8.4 +/- 0.2 fl; p = 0.001). Furthermore, no
      significant difference was noted between groups regarding routine medications
      received by patients. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, MPV was the
      only variable independently related to AF (OR = 2.659; 95% CI, 1.286-5.498; p =
      0.008). Consequently, it is concluded that AF is associated with increased MPV in
      patients with type 2 DM, suggesting the presence of tentatively related processes
      leading to reciprocal interaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess whether changes of major
      atrial fibrillation (AF) risk factors and/or intercurrent cardiovascular events
      could explain the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and
      incident AF. BACKGROUND: Previous studies found an increased risk of incident AF 
      among individuals with T2D, but few, if any, of these studies took into account
      changes of AF risk factors over time. METHODS: A total of 34,720 female health
      professionals who participated in the Women's Health Study, and who were free of 
      cardiovascular disease and AF at baseline were followed for a median of 16.4
      years. Cox proportional-hazards models were constructed to assess the
      relationship between T2D and incident AF, using either information at baseline or
      time-varying covariates for both T2D and potential confounders. RESULTS: At
      baseline, 937 (2.7 %) women had T2D. Compared with women without T2D, women with 
      T2D had an age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for new-onset AF of 1.95 (95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.49 to 2.56; p<0.0001). In multivariable analyses
      adjusting for baseline confounders, this HR was substantially attenuated, but
      baseline T2D remained a significant predictor of incident AF (HR: 1.37, 95% CI:
      1.03 to 1.83; p=0.03). In time-updated models that adjusted for changes in AF
      risk factors and intercurrent cardiovascular events, the HR for T2D was
      attenuated further and became nonsignificant (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.40;
      p=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: Although this study confirms a significant relationship
      between baseline T2D and incident AF, our data suggest that the increased risk
      associated with T2D is mainly mediated by changes of other AF risk factors.

      with risk of permanent atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 247-53
LID - 10.1007/s11606-012-2220-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After an initial episode of atrial fibrillation (AF), AF may recur
      and become permanent. AF progression is associated with higher morbidity and
      mortality. Understanding the risk factors for permanent AF could help identify
      people who would benefit most from interventions. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether
      body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, and blood pressure levels are
      associated with permanent AF among people whose initial AF episode terminated.
      DESIGN: Population-based inception cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Enrollees in Group
      Health, an integrated health care system, aged 30-84 with newly diagnosed AF in
      2001-2004, whose initial AF terminated within 6 months and who had at least 6
      months of subsequent follow-up (N = 1,385). MAIN MEASURES: Clinical
      characteristics were determined from medical records. Permanent AF was determined
      from medical records and ECG and administrative databases. Permanent AF was
      defined as AF present on two separate occasions 6-36 months apart, without any
      documented sinus rhythm between the two occasions. Cox proportional hazards
      models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). KEY RESULTS: Five-year
      cumulative incidence of permanent AF was 24 %. Compared with normal BMI
      (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), BMI levels of 25.0-29.9 (overweight), 30.0-34.9 (obese 1),
      35.0-39.9 (obese 2), and >/= 40.0 kg/m(2) (obese 3) were associated with HRs of
      permanent AF of 1.26 (95 % CI: 0.92, 1.72); 1.35 (0.96, 1.91); 1.50 (0.97, 2.33);
      and 1.79 (1.13, 2.84), adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, blood
      pressure, coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, heart failure, and
      prior stroke. Diabetes, hypertension, and blood pressure were not associated with
      permanent AF. CONCLUSIONS: For people whose initial AF episode terminates,
      benefits of having lower BMI may include a lower risk of permanent AF. Risk of
      permanent AF was similar for people with and without diabetes or hypertension and
      across blood pressure levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional, observational study investigated prevalence and 
      clinical features of atrial fibrillation (AF) in diabetic patient groups with or 
      without autonomic neuropathy. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive
      patients with pharmacologically treated type-II diabetes mellitus were enrolled
      for this study in our institution between January 2010 and December 2010. All
      patients underwent 12-lead electrocardiography on the day of enrollment for AF
      detection. All diabetic patients underwent neurologic examination for the
      presence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN). Following clinical evaluation,
      sympathetic skin responses (SSR) and RR interval variability (RRIV) analysis were
      used for the detection of autonomic neurologic involvement. Patients were divided
      into two groups according to presence (Group 1) or absence (Group 2) of DAN.
      Patient groups with or without DAN were compared for AF occurrence. Continuous
      and categorical data were compared with independent samples t- test and
      Chi-square statistical tests respectively. RESULTS: Atrial fibrillation
      prevalence was 24% (n=29) in study population. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy was 
      diagnosed in 47 (39%) patients. Basal characteristics of patients with or without
      DAN were comparable except glycosylated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) levels. HbA1c levels
      were found significantly higher in patients with DAN. Atrial fibrillation was
      diagnosed in 14 patients in Group 1 and in 15 patients in Group 2. Significantly 
      increased AF prevalence (31.9% vs. 20.8%, p=0.014, in groups with and without DAN
      respectively) was observed in patient group with diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated an increased prevalence of AF 
      in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy compared with non-neuropathic,
      diabetic patients. Further investigation of this relation with prospective
      studies is needed to demonstrate a causal relationship between diabetic autonomic
      neuropathy and AF.

TI  - Obesity, diabetes and atrial fibrillation; epidemiology, mechanisms and
      interventions.
PG  - 253-64
AB  - The last few decades have witnessed a global rise in adult obesity of epidemic
      proportions. The potential impact of this is emphasized when one considers that
      body mass index (BMI) is a powerful predictor of death, type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
      and cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. Similarly we have
      witnessed a parallel rise in the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), the
      commonest sustained cardiac arrhythmia, which is also a significant cause of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Part of this increase is attributable to 
      advances in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) 
      improving life expectancy and consequently the prevalence of AF. However,
      epidemiological studies have demonstrated an independent association between
      obesity and AF, possibly reflecting common pathophysiology and risk factors for
      both conditions. Indeed, weight gain and obesity are associated with structural
      and functional changes of the cardiovascular system including left atrial and
      ventricular remodeling, haemodynamic alterations, autonomic dysfunction, and
      diastolic dysfunction. Moreover, diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by an
      adverse structural and functional cardiac phenotype which may predispose to the
      development of AF [3]. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological and
      mechanistic relationships between obesity, diabetes and AF, and the challenges
      posed in the management of this high-risk group of individuals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
      hyperglycemia on atrial interstitial fibrosis, ionic remodeling and vulnerability
      to atrial fibrillation (AF) in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. METHODS: Sixty
      Japanese rabbits were randomly assigned to alloxan-induced diabetic group (n=30) 
      and control group (n=30). Ten rabbits in each group were respectively used to
      electrophysiological and histological study, patch-clamp study and Western
      blotting analysis. Langendorff perfusion was used to record inter-atrial
      conduction time (IACT), atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and dispersion 
      (AERPD) and vulnerability to AF. Histological study was measured by Sirius-red
      stain. Patch-clamp technique was used to measure action potential duration (APD) 
      and atrial ionic currents (INa and ICaL). Western blotting was applied to assess 
      atrial protein expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1).
      RESULTS: Compared with control group, electrophysiological studies showed IACT
      was prolonged (37.91+/-6.81 vs. 27.43+/-1.63ms, p<0.01), AERPD was increased
      (30.37+/-8.33 vs. 14.70+/-5.16ms, p<0.01) in diabetic group. Inducibility of AF
      in diabetic group was significantly higher than in controls (8/10 vs. 1/10 of
      animals, p<0.01). Collagen volume fraction was increased (6.20+/-0.64% vs.
      2.15+/-0.21%, p<0.01) in diabetic group. Patch-clamp studies demonstrated APD90
      and APD50 were prolonged in diabetic rabbits (p<0.05 vs. control). The densities 
      of INa were reduced and the densities of ICaL were increased (p<0.01 vs.
      control). Protein expression of TGFbeta1 was increased in diabetic group (p<0.001
      vs. control). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that hyperglycemia contributes to
      atrial interstitial fibrosis, ionic remodeling and vulnerability to AF in
      diabetic rabbits, resulting in atrial structural remodeling and electrical
      remodeling for the development and perpetuation of AF.

      patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 2337-9
LID - 10.2337/dc12-0314 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether baseline pulse pressure (PP), a marker of arterial 
      stiffness, is associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 350 type 2 diabetic
      patients, who were free from AF at baseline, were followed for 10 years. A
      standard electrocardiogram was performed annually and a diagnosis of incident AF 
      was confirmed in affected participants by a single cardiologist. RESULTS: During 
      the follow-up, 32 patients (9.1% of total) developed incident AF. After
      adjustments for age, sex, BMI, diabetes duration, presence of left ventricular
      hypertrophy, hypertension treatment, kidney dysfunction, and pre-existing history
      of coronary heart disease, heart failure, and mild valvular disease, baseline PP 
      was associated with an increased incidence of AF (adjusted odds ratio 1.76 for
      each SD increment [95% CI 1.1-2.8]; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest 
      that increased PP independently predicts incident AF in patients with type 2
      diabetes.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have reported on the association between diabetes
      mellitus (DM) and subsequent risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) with inconsistent
      results. Individuals with DM present with an increased risk (approximate 40%) of 
      subsequent AF compared with unaffected individuals, but the mechanisms underlying
      the relationship between DM and AF remains speculative. Both entities share
      common risk factors and, thus, seem to be closely associated with each other.
      Obviously, the quality of glycemic control is directly related with the risk for 
      AF; the risk is higher with longer duration of treated diabetes and poorer
      glycemic control. Future research should identify approaches to reduce the risk
      of AF in people with diabetes by means of consequent screening and
      anti-coagulation therapy.

PG  - 806-12
LID - 10.5114/aoms.2011.25555 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia.
      Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) is a frequent complication of diabetes
      mellitus and has a negative impact on the cardiovascular system. There are no
      data about the occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in the
      population with DAN. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed the data of 100 patients
      with PAF. The study population was divided into three groups: group I: 28
      patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and DAN, group II: 34 patients with DM
      without DAN, and group III: 38 patients without DM. P-wave duration (FPD) and
      dispersion (PWD) were measured during sinus rhythm and AF episodes were counted
      during 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Recurrence of PAF was higher in group I
      (47 episodes/year) compared to groups II and III (26 and 22 episodes/year) -
      p<0.01. The FPD was longer in group I (137.4 +/-12.0 ms vs. 126 +/-23.0 ms in II 
      group and 129 +/-18.3 ms in group III; p<0.001). The PWD was longer in patients
      with DAN (53 +/-19 ms vs. 36 +/-18 ms and 34 +/- 20 ms, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      The results showed that the presence of DAN caused a significant increase in
      P-wave duration and dispersion, which might be responsible for the recurrence of 
      AF.

TI  - Type 2 diabetes, glucose homeostasis and incident atrial fibrillation: the
      Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.
PG  - 133-8
LID - 10.1136/heartjnl-2011-300503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes has been inconsistently associated with the risk of
      atrial fibrillation (AF) in previous studies that have frequently been beset by
      methodological challenges. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The
      Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. PARTICIPANTS: Detailed medical 
      histories were obtained from 13 025 participants. Individuals were categorised as
      having no diabetes, pre-diabetes or diabetes based on the 2010 American Diabetes 
      Association criteria at study baseline (1990-2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnoses
      of incident AF were obtained to the end of 2007. Associations between type 2
      diabetes and markers of glucose homeostasis and the incidence of AF were
      estimated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for possible
      confounders. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes was associated with a significant increase 
      in the risk of AF (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.60) after adjustment for
      confounders. There was no indication that individuals with pre-diabetes or those 
      with undiagnosed diabetes were at increased risk of AF compared with those
      without diabetes. A positive linear association was observed between HbA1c and
      the risk of AF in those with and without diabetes (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.20) 
      and HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15 per 1% point increase, respectively). There was 
      no association between fasting glucose or insulin in those without diabetes, but 
      a significant association with fasting glucose was found in those with the
      condition. The results were similar in white subjects and African-Americans.
      CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, HbA1c level and poor glycaemic control are independently
      associated with an increased risk of AF, but the underlying mechanisms governing 
      the relationship are unknown and warrant further investigation.

TI  - Thiazolidinediones can prevent new onset atrial fibrillation in patients with
      non-insulin dependent diabetes.
PG  - 199-202
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.08.081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulative evidence suggested that oxidative stress and
      inflammation were involved in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF).
      Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
      gamma (PPAR-gamma), have been proven to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant
      effects in addition to their anti-diabetic activity. The goal of this nationwide,
      population based cohort study was to evaluate whether the use of TZDs will
      protect diabetic patients from AF. METHODS: The study population was comprised of
      12,065 non-insulin dependent diabetic patients identified from the "National
      Health Insurance Research Database" released by the Taiwan National Health
      Research Institutes. Among the study patients, a total of 4137 patients with TZD 
      use were recognized as the study cohort and 7928 patients without TZD use were
      included as the comparison cohort. The study endpoint was defined as AF
      occurrence during the follow up period. RESULTS: During the follow up of 63 +/-
      25 months, 194 patients (1.6% of the study population) developed AF: 49 from the 
      study cohort (1.2% of the TZD group) and 145 from the comparison cohort (1.8% of 
      the non-TZD group). After an adjustment for the baseline characteristics and
      medications, the TZDs independently protected diabetic patients from new-onset AF
      with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% confidence interval=0.49-0.91, p value=0.028).
      CONCLUSION: In this cohort study, we demonstrated that TZDs had obvious
      protective effects on the development of AF in diabetic patients. Drugs acting as
      ligands to the PPAR-gamma may be potential up-stream therapies for AF prevention.

TI  - Beneficial effect of pioglitazone on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients
      with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1256-61
LID - 10.1093/europace/eur131 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Pioglitazone, one of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma
      activators, possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In the
      present study, we sought to identify the impact of pioglitazone on the outcome of
      catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 150 consecutive patients
      undergoing catheter ablation of drug-refractory PAF. All patients had a history
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and were divided based on whether they
      received pioglitazone before ablation or not. After grouping, 51 patients treated
      with pioglitazone and 99 control subjects were followed up at least 15 months
      after ablation. After a single ablation, sinus rhythm was maintained in 44
      patients (86.3%) of the pioglitazone group vs. 70 patients (70.7%) of the control
      group (P = 0.034) without antiarrhythmic drug during a mean follow-up of 22.9 +/-
      5.1 months. The second ablation was performed in 5 patients (9.8%) from the
      pioglitazone group and in 24 patients (24.2%) from the control group (P = 0.034).
      Multivariate logistic analysis showed left atrium diameter was associated with a 
      high risk of atrial tachyarrhythmias recurrence, and treatment with
      renin-angiotensin system inhibitor as well as pioglitazone was associated with a 
      reduced atrial tachyarrhythmias recurrence rate. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone
      improved the preservation of sinus rhythm and reduced the reablation rate in
      patients with PAF and T2DM after catheter ablation.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is 1 of the most clinically diagnosed cardiac
      disturbances but little is known about its risk factors. Previous epidemiologic
      studies have reported on the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and
      subsequent risk of AF, with inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to
      conduct a meta-analysis of published studies to reliably determine the direction 
      and magnitude of any association between DM and AF. A systematic review and
      meta-analysis was conducted. PubMed and EMBASE were searched to identify
      prospective cohort and case-control studies that had reported on the association 
      between DM and other measurements of glucose homeostasis with incident AF by
      April 2010. Studies conducted in primarily high-risk populations and participants
      in randomized controlled trials were excluded. Seven prospective cohort studies
      and 4 case-control studies with information on 108,703 cases of AF in 1,686,097
      subjects contributed to this analysis. The summary estimate indicated that
      patients with DM had an approximate 40% greater risk of AF compared to unaffected
      patients (relative risk [RR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10 to 1.75, p
      for heterogeneity <0.001). After correcting for publication bias, the RR was 1.34
      (1.07 to 1.68). Studies that had adjusted for multiple risk factors reported a
      smaller effect estimate compared to age-adjusted studies (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to
      1.44, vs 1.70, 1.29 to 2.22, p for heterogeneity = 0.053). The
      population-attributable fraction of AF owing to DM was 2.5% (95% CI 0.1 to 3.9). 
      In conclusion, DM is associated with an increased risk of subsequent AF but the
      mechanisms that may underpin the relation between DM and AF remain speculative.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus has been reported to be an independent risk factor of atrial
      fibrillation (AF). The present study investigated the atrial substrate properties
      and clinical outcome of catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal AF and
      abnormal glucose metabolism. A total of 228 patients with paroxysmal AF who had
      undergone catheter ablation for the first time were enrolled. An abnormal glucose
      metabolism (n = 65) was defined as diabetes mellitus or an impaired fasting
      glucose. We analyzed the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics in, and 
      the clinical outcome of, patients with AF with and without an abnormal glucose
      metabolism. The right atrial (107.2 +/- 15.4 vs 96.0 +/- 16.5 ms, p < 0.001) and 
      left atrial (108.4 +/- 22.3 vs 94.0 +/- 17.5 ms, p < 0.001) total activation
      times were significantly longer in the patients with AF and an abnormal glucose
      metabolism than in those without an abnormal metabolism. Furthermore, the right
      atrial (1.46 +/- 0.61 vs 2.00 +/- 0.70 mV, p < 0.001) and left atrial (1.48 +/-
      0.74 vs 2.05 +/- 0.78 mV, p < 0.001) bipolar voltages were significantly lower in
      those with AF and an abnormal glucose metabolism than in those without. The AF
      recurrence rate was also greater in the patients with an abnormal glucose
      metabolism (18.5% vs 8.0%, p = 0.022) than in those without. The follow-up
      duration was 18.8 +/- 6.4 months. In conclusion, an abnormal glucose metabolism
      affects the biatrial substrate properties with an intra-atrial conduction delay, 
      decreased voltage, and greater recurrence rate after catheter ablation.

PG  - 31-7
AB  - We examined 212 patients aged 52-70 years with persistent symptomatic atrial
      fibrillation (AF). Comparison of AF substrates in patients with (n=26) and
      without (n=27) type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) revealed slowing of intraatrial
      conduction, increased vulnerability of atria, and more pronounced worsening of
      left ventricular diastolic function among DM2 patients. Comparison of groups of
      patients with (n=32) and without (n=33) diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy
      (CAN) revealed augmentation of adrenergic influences on the heart and
      comparatively higher antirecurrence efficacy of sotalol among patients with CAN. 
      In 94 patients with type 2 DM complicated with CAN after randomization we
      administered antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol in combination with perindopril 
      (n=33), lipoic acid (n=31), perindopril and lipoic acid (n=30), and compared
      results with sotalol monotherapy. In 6 months percentage of patients in sinus
      rhythm was significantly higher in the group of combination therapy (sotalol plus
      perindopril plus lipoic acid). This was probably a result of simultaneous
      correction of disturbances caused by both "diabetic cardiomyopathy" and CAN.

TI  - Diabetes mellitus, glycemic control, and risk of atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 853-8
LID - 10.1007/s11606-010-1340-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes may be an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation.
      However, results from prior studies are in conflict, and no study has examined
      diabetes duration or glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of
      diabetes with risk of atrial fibrillation and to describe risk according to
      diabetes duration and glycemic control. DESIGN: A population-based case-control
      study. PARTICIPANTS: Within a large, integrated healthcare delivery system, we
      identified 1,410 people with newly-recognized atrial fibrillation from ICD-9
      codes and validated cases by review of medical records. 2,203 controls without
      atrial fibrillation were selected from enrollment lists, stratified on age, sex, 
      hypertension, and calendar year. MAIN MEASURES: Information on atrial
      fibrillation, diabetes and other characteristics came from medical records.
      Diabetes was defined based on physician diagnoses recorded in the medical record,
      and pharmacologically treated diabetes was defined as receiving antihyperglycemic
      medications. Information about hemoglobin A1c levels came from computerized
      laboratory data. KEY RESULTS: Among people with atrial fibrillation, 252/1410
      (17.9%) had pharmacologically treated diabetes compared to 311/2203 (14.1%) of
      controls. The adjusted OR for atrial fibrillation was 1.40 (95% CI 1.15-1.71) for
      people with treated diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Among those with
      treated diabetes, the risk of developing atrial fibrillation was 3% higher for
      each additional year of diabetes duration (95% CI 1-6%). Compared to people
      without diabetes, the adjusted OR for people with treated diabetes with average
      hemoglobin A1c <or=7 was 1.06 (95% CI 0.74-1.51); for A1c >7 but <or=8, 1.48
      (1.09-2.01); for A1c >8 but <or=9, 1.46 (1.02-2.08); and for A1c >9, 1.96
      (1.22-3.14). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was associated with higher risk of developing 
      atrial fibrillation, and risk was higher with longer duration of treated diabetes
      and worse glycemic control. Future research should identify and test approaches
      to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation in people with diabetes.

TI  - Influences of autonomic nervous system on atrial arrhythmogenic substrates and
      the incidence of atrial fibrillation in diabetic heart.
PG  - 627-41
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is clinically associated with an increased incidence of
      atrial fibrillation (AF), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We
      hypothesized that neural remodeling enhances AF vulnerability in diabetic hearts.
      Eight weeks after creating streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (DM rats) or
      control rats, the hearts were perfused according to the Langendorff method.
      Inducibility of AF was evaluated by 5 times burst pacing from the right atrium
      and the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was measured. The protocol was 
      repeated during sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) or parasympathetic nerve
      stimulation (PNS). In tissue samples taken from the right atrium, the density of 
      nerves positive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
      were determined. SNS significantly increased the incidence of AF in DM rats (14
      +/- 6 to 30 +/- 8%, P < 0.01), but not in control rats (11 +/- 4 to 14 +/- 6%,
      NS). Although AERP was significantly decreased by SNS in both rats (each P <
      0.01), increased heterogeneity of AERP by SNS was seen only in DM rats. PNS
      significantly decreased AERP and increased the incidence of AF (9 +/- 5 to 30 +/-
      5% in control rats, 12 +/- 6 to 27 +/- 6% in DM rats, each P < 0.01) in both
      rats. The density of TH-positive nerves was heterogeneous in DM rats compared
      with control rats, whereas the heterogeneity of AChE-positive nerves was not
      different in the rats. The prevalence of AF was enhanced by adrenergic activation
      in diabetic hearts, in which heterogeneous sympathetic innervation was evident.
      These results suggest that neural remodeling may play a crucial role for
      increased AF vulnerability in DM.

TI  - Independent contribution of diabetes to increased prevalence and incidence of
      atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1851-6
LID - 10.2337/dc09-0939 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetes has long been recognized as a risk factor for atrial
      fibrillation, but its independent contribution to atrial fibrillation has not
      been fully evaluated. We sought to compare the prevalence and incidence of atrial
      fibrillation in age- and sex-matched patients with and without type 2 diabetes.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using an observational cohort design, we selected
      10,213 members of an HMO diabetes registry as of 1 January 1999 plus 7,159
      patients who entered the registry by 31 December 2004 and matched them to
      patients without diabetes on year of birth and sex. All patients were followed
      until they died, left the health plan, or until 31 December 2008. We compared the
      baseline prevalence of atrial fibrillation and then followed patients without
      atrial fibrillation to compare atrial fibrillation incidence while controlling
      for known risk factors. RESULTS: Atrial fibrillation prevalence was significantly
      greater among patients with diabetes (3.6 vs. 2.5%, P < 0.0001). Over a mean
      follow-up of 7.2 +/- 2.8 years, diabetic patients without atrial fibrillation at 
      baseline developed atrial fibrillation at an age- and sex-adjusted rate of 9.1
      per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 8.6-9.7) compared with a rate of 6.6 (6.2-7.1)
      among nondiabetic patients. After full adjustment for other risk factors,
      diabetes was associated with a 26% increased risk of atrial fibrillation among
      women (hazard ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.08-1.46]), but diabetes was not a
      statistically significant factor among men (1.09 [0.96-1.24]). CONCLUSIONS: In
      this population, diabetes was an independent determinant of atrial fibrillation
      prevalence but predicted incidence only among women. These findings have
      potential public health implications and emphasize the need for further
      investigation of the mechanistic links between diabetes and atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Prevention of diabetes represents an important therapeutic goal in current
      cardiovascular risk reduction strategies. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin
      system has been shown to markedly reduce the incidence of new-onset diabetes in
      different patient populations. Recent results from three large clinical endpoint 
      trials with the angiotensin-II receptor blocker telmisartan regarding new-onset
      diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypotrophy will be discussed.

TI  - Risks of cardiovascular events and effects of routine blood pressure lowering
      among patients with type 2 diabetes and atrial fibrillation: results of the
      ADVANCE study.
PG  - 1128-35
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehp055 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate serious clinical outcomes
      associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the effects of routine blood
      pressure lowering on such outcomes in the presence or absence of AF, among
      individuals with type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: About 11 140 patients with
      type 2 diabetes (7.6% of whom had AF at baseline) were randomized to a fixed
      combination of perindopril and indapamide or placebo in the Action in Diabetes
      and Vascular Disease: preterAx and diamicroN-MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE)
      study. We compared total mortality and cardiovascular disease outcomes and
      effects of randomized treatment for 4.3 years on such outcomes between patients
      with and without AF at baseline. After multiple adjustments, AF was associated
      with a 61% (95% confidence interval 31-96, P < 0.0001) greater risk of all-cause 
      mortality and comparable higher risks of cardiovascular death, stroke, and heart 
      failure (all P < 0.001). Routine treatment with a fixed combination of
      perindopril and indapamide produced similar relative, but greater absolute, risk 
      reductions for all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities in patients with AF,
      compared with those without AF. The number of patients needed to be treated with 
      perindopril-indapamide for 5 years to prevent one cardiovascular death was 42 for
      patients with AF and 120 for patients without AF at baseline. CONCLUSION: Atrial 
      fibrillation is relatively common in type 2 diabetes and is associated with
      substantially increased risks of death and cardiovascular events in patients with
      type 2 diabetes. This arrhythmia identifies individuals who are likely to obtain 
      greater absolute benefits from blood pressure-lowering treatment. Atrial
      fibrillation in diabetic patients should be regarded as a marker of particularly 
      adverse outcome and prompt aggressive management of all risk factors.

PG  - 91-3
LID - 10.1097/MCA.0b013e3283219e61 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the severity of coronary artery disease by coronary
      angiography in age-matched and sex-matched patients with diabetes mellitus with
      atrial fibrillation versus sinus rhythm. METHODS: The patients included 245 men
      and women, mean age of 70 years, with diabetes and atrial fibrillation and 245
      age-matched and sex-matched patients with diabetes and sinus rhythm who underwent
      coronary angiography. Baseline characteristics and indications for coronary
      angiography were similar in both groups. RESULTS: Greater than 50% narrowing of
      one, two, or three major coronary arteries were present in 229 of 245 patients
      (94%) with diabetes and atrial fibrillation and in 211 of 245 patients (86%) with
      diabetes and with sinus rhythm (P<0.01). Greater than 50% narrowing of three
      major coronary arteries were present in 150 of 245 patients (61%) with diabetes
      and atrial fibrillation and in 75 of 245 patients (31%) with diabetes and sinus
      rhythm (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with diabetes and atrial fibrillation have
      a significantly higher prevalence of greater than 50% narrowing of one or more
      major coronary arteries and of three major coronary arteries than patients with
      diabetes and sinus rhythm.

TI  - Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with diabetes mellitus type 
      2: results from a randomized study comparing pulmonary vein isolation versus
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy.
PG  - 22-8

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) often
      coexist; however, a small number of patients with DM2 undergoing catheter
      ablation (CA) of AF have been included in previous studies. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate safety and efficacy of ablation therapy in DM2 patients with drug
      refractory AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2005 to September 2006, 70
      patients with a diagnosis of DM2 and paroxysmal (n = 29) or persistent (n = 41)
      AF were randomized to receive either pulmonary vein isolation or a new
      antiarrhythmic drug treatment (ADT) with a 1-year follow-up. The primary endpoint
      was the time to first AF recurrence. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, at the end of
      follow-up, 42.9% of patients in the ADT group and 80% of patients who received a 
      single ablation procedure and were without medications were free of AF (P =
      0.001). In the ablation group, a significant improvement in quality-of-life (QoL)
      scores as compared with ADT group was observed. Six patients in the ADT group
      (17.1%) developed significant adverse drug effects. Hospitalization rate during
      follow-up was higher in the ADT group (P = 0.01). The only complication
      attributable to ablation was one significant access-site hematoma. CONCLUSION: In
      patients with DM2, CA of AF provides significant clinical benefits over the ADT
      and appears to be a reasonable approach regarding feasibility, effectiveness, and
      low procedural risk.

TI  - Chronic atrial fibrillation: Incidence, prevalence, and prediction of stroke
      using the Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age >75, Diabetes mellitus, and
      prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS2) risk stratification scheme.
PG  - 57-64
LID - 10.1016/j.ahj.2008.03.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is to estimate the incidence and prevalence of
      chronic AF (cAF) in the United Kingdom and test the accuracy of the CHADS2 score 
      for stroke prediction. METHODS: The General Practice Research Database was used
      to identify patients aged 40+ years diagnosed with cAF and control patients.
      Harrell's C-statistic was used to test possible improvements in CHADS2. RESULTS: 
      The study population included 51,807 cAF patients. The incidence of cAF increased
      by age and was higher in men than women. The prevalence of cAF has increased over
      time. The excess 5-year risk for stroke in cAF patients correlated well with
      CHADS2 as follows: score 0, 1.9% (95% CI 1.6-2.1); 1, 3.0% (95% CI 2.7-3.3); 2,
      4.7% (95% CI 4.3-5.1); 3, 7.2% (95% CI 6.6-7.9); 4, 10.5% (95% CI 9.4-11.5); 5,
      13.9% (95% CI 12.2-15.5); and 6, 15.8% (95% CI 13.5-18.1). Adding sex, the
      extension of age categories and reweighing of established risk factors improved
      CHADS2 accuracy (C-statistic 0.68-0.72). Applying the reclassification resulted
      in a substantial number of patients changing stroke risk category. CONCLUSION:
      Atrial fibrillation is a prevalent and growing problem, which significantly
      increases the risk of ischemic stroke. The CHADS2 score is a good predictor of
      the stroke risk but could be improved.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of effect of valsartan/amlodipine and atenolol/amlodipine 
      combinations on atrial fibrillation recurrence in hypertensive patients with type
      2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 217-22
LID - 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318160b42a [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effect of valsartan/amlodipine and
      atenolol/amlodipine combination in preventing the recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation (AF) in hypertensive diabetic patients with a history of recent
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Two hundred ninety-six hypertensive patients with
      well-controlled type 2 diabetes in sinus rhythm but with at least 2
      ECG-documented episodes of AF in the previous 6 months were randomized to 160 mg 
      of valsartan plus amlodipine (titrated from 2.5 to 10 mg) or to 100 mg of
      atenolol plus amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg) in addition to their previous
      antiarrhythmic treatment (if any) and were followed up for 1 year. Blood pressure
      (BP) and a 24-hour ECG were evaluated monthly. The patients were asked to report 
      any episode of symptomatic AF and to perform an ECG as early as possible. SBP/DBP
      values were significantly reduced after 12 months with valsartan/amlodipine (from
      150.4/93.5 to 126.37/7.4 mm Hg, P < 0.001) and atenolol/amlodipine (from
      151.1/94.2 to 127.1/77.9 mm Hg, P < 0.001), with no difference between the 2
      regimens. At least 1 ECG-documented episode of AF was reported in 20.3% of the
      patients treated with valsartan/amlodipine and in 34.1% of those treated with
      atenolol/amlodipine, with a significant difference between treatments (P < 0.01).
      The positive effect of valsartan/amlodipine combination on AF recurrence was more
      evident in patients treated with amiodarone or propafenone than in patients
      treated with other antiarrhythmic drugs or without antiarrhythmic treatment.
      Despite similar BP reduction, valsartan/amlodipine combination was more effective
      in patients treated with amiodarone or propafenone than atenolol/amlodipine in
      preventing new episodes of AF in hypertensive diabetic patients.

TI  - Impact of new-onset diabetes mellitus on development of atrial fibrillation and
      heart failure in high-risk hypertension (from the VALUE Trial).
PG  - 634-8
LID - 10.1016/j.amjcard.2007.10.025 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) are known risk factors for atrial
      fibrillation (AF). We investigated the influence of new-onset DM on developing AF
      in the VALUE trial population of high-risk hypertensive patients. Five thousand
      two hundred fifty patients of the 15,245 participants in the VALUE trial had DM
      at baseline and 1,298 of the initially nondiabetic patients developed DM during
      the average 4.2-year follow-up. The presence of AF was determined by central
      analyzed electrocardiograms at baseline and changes were assessed yearly.
      Patients without AF at baseline and with any AF by later electrocardiograms were 
      defined as patients with new-onset AF. Patients with new-onset and baseline DM
      were compared with patients without DM by a Cox regression model with adjustment 
      for prespecified covariates. Five hundred fifty-one patients developed new-onset 
      AF during the trial. Patients with new-onset DM had a significantly higher event 
      rate of new-onset AF with a hazard ratio of 1.49 (1.14 to 1.94, p = 0.0031)
      compared with patients without DM, and there was a trend toward more AF in
      patients with DM at baseline. Patients with new-onset DM had also more persistent
      AF (hazard ratio 1.87, 1.28 to 2.74, p = 0.0014). Patients with new-onset DM and 
      AF had a hazard ratio of 3.56 for heart failure (2.86 to 4.44, p <0.0001)
      compared with patients with new-onset DM without AF. In conclusion, hypertensive 
      patients who developed DM during the VALUE trial had more AF than did patients
      without DM, and this may explain some of their concomitant high risk of
      hospitalization for heart failure.

      direct current cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 181-7
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcm123 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine independent risk factors for recurrence of atrial fibrillation 
      (AF) after a successful direct current (DC) cardioversion in patients with and
      without diabetes. DESIGN: We retrospectively analysed the outcome in patients
      recently diagnosed with persistent AF. METHODS: Of 364 patients included, 289 had
      a successful direct current (DC) cardioversion. We compared 42 (14.5%) patients
      known to have diabetes to 247 (85.5%) without. Patients were reviewed in
      outpatient clinic with assessment of heart rhythm clinically and by
      electrocardiogram. Median follow-up after DC cardioversion was 74 days
      [interquartile range (IQR) 69-78 days]. RESULTS: When reviewed in outpatient
      clinic, only 63.7% (185 of 289) were still in sinus rhythm (SR). Of the group
      without diabetes, 66.8% (165 of 247) remained in SR vs. 45.2% (19 of 42) of the
      group with diabetes (P = 0.005). Binary logistic regression analysis showed
      duration of AF (P < 0.0001) and the presence of diabetes (P = 0.019) have been
      independent risk factors for recurrence of AF. DISCUSSION: Presence of diabetes
      and the longer duration of AF were independent risk factors for the recurrence of

TI  - [Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and antiplatelet in diabetes mellitus
      type 2. How do we do it?].
PG  - 37-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: In spite of evidence about the interest of anticoagulation in Atrial 
      Fibrillation (AF) and antiplatelet to diabetics (DM) type 2, the national and
      international references describe a low level of assumption of those criteria in 
      practice. Published studies on these aspects are unavailable in Navarre. METHODS:
      Cross-sectional study. POPULATION: primary care patients (1,600 people > 15
      years). INCLUSION CRITERIA: patients diagnosed of AF / with diagnosis of DM type 
      2, over 40. VARIABLES: age and sex, criteria of AF with high embolic risk (>6%
      annual) and cardiovascular risk factors in DM2. DATA COLLECTION: in computerised 
      registers of Organisation and Management Information. ANALYSIS: (population
      universe studied), results in absolute numbers and percentages. RESULTS:
      Twenty-five people with diagnosis of chronic FA (14 women and 11 men, average age
      78.36 years); 22 (81.8%) show high embolic risk. There were counter-indications
      in 4 cases. Type 2 diabetics totalled 69 people (29 women and 40 men, average age
      68.57 years). There are 16 (23.1%) in primary prevention (PP), 26 (37.3%) in
      secondary prevention (SP), and 27 (39.1%) do not follow antiplatelet therapy.
      There is counter-indication in 8 cases and 14 patients (20.2%) would be
      susceptible to intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The results of oral anticoagulant
      therapy (OAT) in high risk AF exceed the reviewed references. The PP with DM2 are
      similar figures to other studies; a area of improvement was detected. We must ask
      for the opinion of the patient and individualise these therapies. The family
      doctor has a significant responsibility in cardiovascular prevention of the
      patients affected by these problems.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with 
      diabetes mellitus--single center experience.
PG  - 41-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the outcome of catheter ablation 
      of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). We
      investigated the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of AF in patients with 
      DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty one patients with DM from a group of 263
      consecutive patients undergoing a first-time catheter ablation of AF procedure
      were enrolled in a prospective study. The ablation protocol (guided by CARTO
      system) consisted in two continuous circular lesions around ipsilateral pulmonary
      veins. RESULTS: The following clinical characteristics differed between DM and
      no-DM patients: age (62.0 +/- 10.8 vs. 56.1 +/- 10.6 years, P = 0.004), longer AF
      history (9.6 +/- 9.3 vs. 6.7 +/- 6.3 years, P = 0.024), significantly larger left
      atrium size (41.1 +/- 7.8 vs. 38.3 +/- 5.8 mm, P = 0.021), hypertension (58.1 vs.
      35.8%, P = 0.018) and structural heart disease (67.7 vs. 43.5%, P = 0.011).
      Despite a similar AF recurrence rate in DM and no-DM patients (32.3 vs. 22.4%, P 
      = 0.240), the ablation procedure was complicated in 28 patients (11 hematomas,
      three cardiac tamponades and three strokes) and the incidence of complications
      was significantly higher in DM than in no-DM patients (29.0 vs. 8.2%,
      respectively, P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that DM was an independent
      risk factor for complications occurrence (odd ratio 5.936, 95% confidence
      interval 2.059 to 17.112, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: First catheter ablation of AF 
      procedure in DM patients was equally efficacious than in no-DM patients. However,
      DM patients had a higher incidence of complications, mostly thrombotic or
      hemorrhagic.

TI  - Effects of cardioversion of atrial fibrillation on endothelial function in
      hypertension or diabetes.
PG  - 26-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardioversion (CV) to sinus rhythm corrects endothelial dysfunction
      secondary to atrial fibrillation (AF). As AF often complicates hypertension and
      diabetes (disorders associated with impaired endothelial function) the study
      probed whether these comorbidities to AF produced an additive effect and to what 
      extent CV might be advantageous. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was evaluated before and after CV in 17 lone AF
      patients (group 1), 16 patients with AF + hypertension (group 2) and 17 patients 
      with AF + diabetes type II (group 3), while in supine and head-up tilting (HUT)
      positions, as this is when endothelial vasodilation is emphasized as a
      counterbalance to neurogenic vasoconstriction. RESULTS: After 2 weeks, CV in
      group 1 increased (P < 0.01) supine FMD (from 7.22-->9.50%) and restored its HUT 
      potentiation (from 9.31-->17.22%). In group 2, FMD also improved significantly
      with CV (supine from 4.92-->7.11% and HUT from 5.29-->11.83%; P < 0.01). In group
      3, CV did not promote significant FMD changes (supine from 5.12-->4.92% and HUT
      from 4.98-->4.73%). After 3 months, FMD improvement persisted in groups 1 and 2
      with enduring sinus rhythm, but not in those with AF relapse. In group 3, FMD
      remained unchanged regardless of cardiac rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: Cardioversion
      persistently increases supine shear stress endothelial responsiveness and
      restores the orthostatic modulation in AF alone or in association with
      hypertension, but not with diabetes. Differences in background endothelial
      impairment may explain the presence (hypertension) or the absence (diabetes) of
      an additive AF effect in comorbidities, as well as CV results.

TI  - Endothelial dysfunction and exercise performance in lone atrial fibrillation or
      associated with hypertension or diabetes: different results with cardioversion.
PG  - H921-8
AB  - Endothelial dysfunction and underperfusion of exercising muscle contribute to
      exercise intolerance, hyperventilation, and breathlessness in atrial fibrillation
      (AF). Cardioversion (CV) improves endothelial function and exercise performance. 
      We examined whether CV is equally beneficial in diabetes and hypertension,
      diseases that cause endothelial dysfunction and are often associated with AF.
      Cardiopulmonary exercise and pulmonary and endothelial (brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilation) function were tested before and after CV in patients with
      AF alone (n = 18, group 1) or AF with hypertension (n = 19, group 2) or diabetes 
      (n = 19, group 3). Compared with group 1, peak exercise workload, O2 consumption 
      (Vo2), O2 pulse, aerobic efficiency (Delta Vo2/Delta WR), and ratio of brachial
      diameter changes to flow changes (Delta D/Delta F) were reduced in group 2 and,
      to a greater extent, in group 3; exercise ventilation efficiency (Ve/Vco2 slope) 
      and dead space-to-tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt) were similar among groups. CV had
      less effect on peak workload (+7% vs. +18%), peak Vo2 (+12% vs. +17%), O2 pulse
      (+33% vs. +50%), Delta Vo2/Delta WR (+7% vs. +12%), Ve/Vco2 slope (-6% vs. -12%),
      Delta D/Delta F (+7% vs. +10%), and breathlessness (Borg scale) in group 2 than
      in group 1 and was ineffective in group 3. The antioxidant vitamin C, tested in
      eight additional patients in each cohort, improved flow-mediated dilation in
      groups 1 and 2 before, but not after, CV and was ineffective in group 3,
      suggesting that the oxidative injury is least in lone AF, greater in hypertension
      with AF, and greater still in diabetes with AF. Comorbidities that impair
      endothelial activity worsen endothelial dysfunction and exercise intolerance in
      AF. The advantages of CV appear to be inversely related to the extent of the
      underlying oxidative injury.

TI  - Diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation: perspectives on epidemiological and
      pathophysiological links.
PG  - 319-21
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, which
      is also associated with a substantial risk of mortality and morbidity from
      stroke, thromboembolism, heart failure and hospitalisations. On a epidemiological
      basis, diabetes mellitus is commonly associated with AF. Nonetheless, AF is also 
      associated with vascular disease and hypertension, which are themselves
      intimately linked to diabetes. Indeed, the precise pathophysiological and
      clinical relationships between AF and diabetes mellitus are not completely
      understood. What we do know is that both diabetes and AF are individually bad for
      our patients, and the presence of both requires aggressive management strategies.

TI  - Diabetes mellitus is a strong, independent risk for atrial fibrillation and
      flutter in addition to other cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 315-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis.
      There is a controversy in literature about correlation between DM and atrial
      fibrillation. The goal of this study was to evaluate DM as a risk factor for
      atrial fibrillation or flutter using a very large database. METHOD: Patient
      treatment files (PTF) containing discharge diagnoses were utilized using ICD-9
      codes of inpatient treatment from Veterans Health Administration Hospitals (VAH).
      Patients with type II DM (ICD-9 code 250.0) (293,124) discharged from the VAH
      between 1990 and 2000. Non-matched controls without DM but with hypertension
      (552,624) were selected from the same PTF. By using multi-variate logistic
      regressions, the occurrence of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, CHF, CAD and 
      LVH was compared. RESULTS: Atrial fibrillations occurred in 43,674 (14.9%) DM
      patients vs. 57,077 (10.3%) in the control group (p<0.0001). Atrial flutter
      occurred in 11,852 (4%) of DM patients vs. 13,554 (2.5%) of the control group
      (p<0.0001). Using multi-variant analysis, DM remained independently associated
      with atrial fibrillation with an OR of 2.13, (95% CI: 2.10 to 2.16; p<0.0001) and
      flutter (OR 2.20, CI: 2.15 to 2.26; p<0.0001). Furthermore, CHF (OR 3.12, CI:
      3.09 to 3.16; p<0.0001), LVH (OR 1.85, CI: 1.77 to 1.92; p<0.0001) and CAD (OR
      2.39, CI: 2.34 to 2.44; p<0.0001) were also independently associated with DM.
      CONCLUSION: This is the first large-scale study finding DM as a strong,
      independent risk for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and flutter and other 
      cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation and its association with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in 
      a Swedish community.
PG  - 367-74
AB  - AIM: To explore the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients with
      hypertension and type 2 diabetes and to identify possible mechanisms for the
      development of atrial fibrillation. METHODS: A community-based, cross-sectional
      observational study was conducted in the primary health care in Skara, Sweden,
      and 1739 subjects (798 men, 941 women) were surveyed. Patients were categorized
      as those with hypertension only (n = 597); those with both hypertension and type 
      2 diabetes (n = 171), and those with type 2 diabetes only (n = 147). In the
      reference population, 824 normotensive subjects without diabetes were identified 
      and used as controls. Participants were examined for cardiovascular risk factors 
      including fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, blood pressure, lipids and
      anthropometric measures. Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded and
      Minnesota-coded. Insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model
      assessment (HOMA). RESULTS: Age-adjusted prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 2%
      in patients with hypertension only, 6% in patients with both hypertension and
      type 2 diabetes, 4% in patients with type 2 diabetes only and 2% in controls,
      respectively. Age and sex adjusted odds ratios (OR) (95% CI) were; hypertension
      0.7 (0.30-1.5), combined hypertension and type 2 diabetes 3.3 (1.6-6.7), and type
      2 diabetes 2.0 (0.9-4.7). The association with combined hypertension and type 2
      diabetes remained significant when adjusted for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
      factors and body mass index (BMI), was attenuated with adjustment for ischemic
      ECG; 2.4 (1.1-5.0) and lost significance with adjustment for insulin resistance; 
      1.3 (0.5-3.1). CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation is associated with the combined
      occurrence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Insulin resistance may be a
      common underlying mechanism.

TI  - Diabetes influences the cardiac symptoms related to atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 835-8
AB  - It is well known that diabetes mellitus (DM) masks the cardiac symptoms during an
      ischemic heart attack, but there have not been reports of whether DM influences
      the subjective symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AF). The present study
      retrospectively assessed 65 patients who were revealed to be in sinus rhythm at
      their first visit to hospital and who had experienced episodes of AF (or
      paroxysmal AF) during the follow-up period. Compared with non-DM cases (n=50), DM
      patients (n=15) had a tendency to a more rapid heart rate in sinus rhythm (73+/-4
      vs 66+/-2, p=0.07) and higher averaged ventricular response at the first-recorded
      episode of AF (111+/-7 vs 99+/-3, p=0.10). However, the ratio of symptomatic
      cases at first-recorded AF tended to be lower in DM cases (33% vs 58%, p=0.08).
      When patients with beta-blockers or other antiarrhythmic agents were excluded,
      the ratio of symptomatic patients at first-recorded AF was significantly lower in
      the DM cases (25% vs 61%, p=0.04), although there was not a significant
      difference in averaged ventricular response at first-recorded AF (112+/-8 vs
      106+/-5). The prevalence of DM neuropathy was significantly higher in
      asymptomatic patients (70% vs 0%, p=0.01). DM may mask the cardiac symptoms of
      the first-recorded episode of AF, possibly because of DM neuropathy.

TI  - Diabetic atrial fibrillation patients: mortality and risk for stroke or embolism 
      during a 10-year follow-up.
PG  - 320-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: To compare in atrial fibrillation patients with and without diabetes,
      (1) baseline characteristics, (2) additional risk factors for stroke or
      peripheric or visceral embolism (hypertension, previous stroke, age >75 years),
      (3) mortality, (4) stroke or embolism, and (5) oral anticoagulation in the year
      2000. METHODS: Included were 409 outpatients with nonrheumatic atrial
      fibrillation (62 +/- 12 years, 36% female). All underwent transthoracic and
      transesophageal echocardiography. Patients with thrombi received oral
      anticoagulation; patients without thrombi received aspirin until the follow-up in
      1995; afterwards, oral anticoagulation according to risk factors for stroke or
      embolism was recommended. Patients were contacted during the year 2000. RESULTS: 
      Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 73 patients (18%). Sixteen (22%) diabetic and
      169 (50%) nondiabetic patients had no other risk factors for stroke or embolism
      (p < 0.0001). Diabetic patients were older, had more frequent heart failure,
      hypertension, myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, valvular
      abnormalities, left atrial or appendage thrombi, larger left atria, and left
      atrial appendages than nondiabetic patients. Mean follow-up was 115 months.
      Diabetic patients had a higher mortality than nondiabetic patients (7%/year
      versus 4%/year, p < 0.0001). The rate of stroke or embolism of diabetic (3%/year)
      and nondiabetic patients (2%/year) was similar. The rate of oral anticoagulation 
      was higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients (p = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS:
      Diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation frequently have additional risk
      factors for stroke or embolism, and thus should be treated with oral
      anticoagulation. Whether in the rare cases of atrial fibrillation, in whom
      diabetes is the only clinical risk factor, oral anticoagulation is indicated
      cannot be answered by the present study.

TI  - [Effect of diabetes mellitus in recovery and maintenance of sinus rhythm in
      patients with persistent atrial fibrillation].
PG  - 189-92
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is frequently accompanied by cardiac rhythm
      disorders. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiac
      arrhythmia in adult population [1, 2]. According to some of the large
      epidemiological studies diabetes mellitus is among independent risk factors for
      development and persistence of atrial fibrillation [3]. Both diabetes mellitus
      and atrial fibrillation independently increase the risk of thromboembolism,
      especially of stroke [3-5]. It is obvious that rhythm control, i.e. restoration
      and maintenance of sinus rhythm, may be essential for prevention of
      thromboembolism in these patients. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is
      to analyse the impact of diabetes mellitus on rhythm control in patients with
      persistent atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We analysed the impact of diabetes
      mellitus and other clinical and echocardiographic parameters (age, gender,
      current arrhythmia duration, presence of previous episodes of persistent atrial
      fibrillation, cardiac and/or noncardiac diseases, left atrial diameter and left
      ventricular ejection fraction) on outcome of attempted cardioversion in patients 
      with persistent atrial fibrillation admitted to Cardiologic Department of the
      Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, between January 
      1992 and December 1999. We also analysed retrospectively the impact of diabetes
      mellitus and other parameters listed above on the presence of previous episodes
      of atrial fibrillation in our patients, that at our opinion reflected the
      possibilities of sinus rhythm maintenance in these patients. All continuous
      parameters were expressed as mean value and standard deviation. Statistical
      significance of differences between variables was examined using Chi-square test.
      For identification of independent predictors of examined outcomes we used
      multiple logistic regression model with 95% of confidence interval. Statistical
      analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)
      programme. RESULTS: Of 378 patients with currently persistent atrial
      fibrillation, aged mean 53.98 +/- 11.69 years, there were 266 (70.4%) men.
      Diabetes mellitus was previously diagnosed in 27 (7.1%) patients, cardiac
      diseases in 223 (59.0%), noncardiac diseases in 47 (12.4%) and 140 (37.0%)
      patients had "lone" atrial fibrillation. Left atrial enlargement was noted in 224
      (59.3%) patients, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in 82 (21.7%).
      Atrial fibrillation lasted 48 hours to 9 years, mean 8.5 +/- 18.14 months before 
      cardioversion. While 43 patients had previous episodes of persistent AF for last 
      1-30 years, mean 10.5 +/- 7.3,335 patients never experienced AF before. There was
      a statistically significant difference in percent of diabetic patients (18.6%/43 
      vs. 5.7%/335, value of Chi-square test = 7.759, p < 0.01) in these two groups. We
      analysed the impact of diabetes mellitus on outcome of attempted cardioversion
      and on presence of previous episodes of AF reflecting the success in maintaining 
      sinus rhythm. Multiple logistic regression models for all of 378 patients, with
      dependent variable being present in previous recurrent atrial fibrillations and
      independent variables of clinical and echocardiographic parameters as listed,
      identified diabetes mellitus to be an independent predictor of repeated atrial
      fibrillations with relative risk of 4.6 (CI 95%). When dependent variable in the 
      same model was outcome of cardioversion (sinus rhythm is restored in 281/378
      patients--74%) diabetes mellitus was not among independent predictors of
      successful cardioversion. DISCUSSION: The relationship between atrial
      fibrillation and diabetes mellitus is not completely understood, including the
      impact of known complications of diabetes mellitus on electrophysiological
      properties of atrial myocardium and development of atrial fibrillation [6].
      Besides being the independent risk factor for occurrence of atrial fibrillation, 
      diabetes mellitus, according to our results, appears to influence the
      possibilities of maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of permanent atrial
      fibrillation in diabetic patients. We found that patients with diabetes mellitus 
      and persistent atrial fibrillation may be successfully converted to sinus rhythm 
      like any other group of patients, but the presence of diabetes mellitus increases
      the risk of arrhythmia recurrence for 4.6 times compared to patients without
      diabetes mellitus. Obviously, diabetic patients need to be treated with more
      efficacious antiarrhythmics from the very beginning, including amiodarone, which 
      successfully prevents recurrent atrial fibrillation in the majority of patients
      [7, 8]. CONCLUSION: We concluded that diabetes mellitus independently predicts
      the presence of recurrent atrial fibrillation but does not influence the
      possibility of sinus rhythm restoration. The relationship between atrial
      fibrillation and diabetes mellitus needs further investigation.

AB  - Clinical findings and cranial CT scan identified stroke in 315 admitted patients 
      at Taichung Veterans General Hospital from January 1, 1989 to December 31, 1989. 
      Hemorrhage was found in 137 cases and infarction in 178 cases (thrombosis in 124 
      cases, embolism in 54 cases). Most cases with stroke (72.4%) were distributed in 
      ages between 55 and 74 years. The mean age of patient with cerebral infarction
      was 64.8 years, which was about 3.3 years higher than those with cerebral
      hemorrhage (mean age 61.5 years). The control group consisted of 117 persons
      (matched in age and sex) who had no history of stroke. In comparison of the five 
      risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, transient
      ischemic attack, and smoking) between the patients and the controls, we found
      that cerebral thrombosis was significantly associated with hypertension, diabetes
      mellitus, and smoking; cerebral embolism with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, 
      and transient ischemic attack; and cerebral hemorrhage with hypertension only.

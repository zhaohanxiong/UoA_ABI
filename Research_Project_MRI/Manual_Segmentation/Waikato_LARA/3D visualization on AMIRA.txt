3D visualization of masks/labels/predictions

- drag image sequence into amira
- go to 3rd tab for segmentation
- select image sequence to create a AMIRA label
- click new
- go to bottom on 5th tab for thresholding
- click select
- click the plus sign in red above (now the label is created)

- right click -> compute -> surface gen
- click apply at the bottom (surface is now generated)
- right click on surface generate -> display -> surface view
- settings: shaded, color normal, more option fancy alpha


3D distance visualization between two masks/labels

- create surface for both masks/labels
- right click -> compute -> surface distance
- right click on white square on surface distance -> click surface 2
- tick distance for output
- click apply (distance is now generated in 3D)
- right click -> display -> surface view
- use seismic/volrenGreen color map ad adjust limits to max/min distances
